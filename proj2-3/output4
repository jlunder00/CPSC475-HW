okay test one two three four five five four three two test one two three four five five four three two one okay um hum okay okay uh i ve been in columbus since nineteen seventy seven and uh i an air traffic controller and i have three more days to work before i retire i reti i i ha i retiring sunday so and tomorrow my dinner so uh a little nervous about what i have to do there yknow they ve told me nothing except show up uh i have a daughter at i know that a bad word for you guys and i have one at northland highschool she a sophomore there and the one at a freshman and uh i married and uh what else i live in uh northeast columbus by seventy one and one sixty one and that about it uh i originally from indiana but i lived up in uh amherst ohio i lived there for about four years and then i because i worked at a place called cleveland center which is an air route traffic control center and i moved from there to ohio state airport and i worked there for nineteen years and uh then i transferred to port columbus about two ye two and a half years ago right um hum um hum oh okay oh yeah yeah oh wow oh so you have it on the speed dial yeah um hum yeah right yeah um hum oh i don know what kind that is because i know they they traded airplanes since i ve been gone yeah oh because uh some of the newer ones jets there like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner i mean it there are prop planes that are like five times as noisy so oh um oh they do now because they wouldn let them when we i was there oh okay oh yeah uh they uh stopped federally funding uh that was a federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and yknow some people moved like to arizona and california and and i thought well since i only have like two and a half years til i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i don want to roo uproot my daughters out of school and and leave and start over so i thought well i ll just go to port columbus and suffer it out until i can retire yeah well i don really like the uh i don li li i really don like that job but uh yknow i like the people there but it like uh way too busy i think oh it can be yeah yeah there are there are times when it all just there a uh group over there called star check and they fly checks like if you write a check today and you deposit at the bank well that check has to go from your bank to clearinghouse and that all they do all night long right tuesday wednesday and thursday every night so like thirty of them will go out at one time and thirty will come back well that isn too bad but they re mixed in with everybody else that normally flying like all the airliners and stuff so and they want to get there a a so yknow i i just don feel comfortable doing that much at one time i mean not that is not a was not a a dead place yknow it was very busy it like the third busiest in ohio but uh yeah it amazing and they re only open sixteen hours a day so yknow um it it pretty pretty busy there but it it sp spread out over the sixteen hours is where as port columbus sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eighty airplanes in an hours time so uh well we have an upstairs and downstairs upstairs is the tower and there like a uh ground control a clearance levry level which reads all the clearances all the airplanes and the ground control taxis them to and from the runway and the tower works everybody landing and departing or any airplane within five mile radius then once they get out of that radius downstairs which is called the approach control they work everything from there to ten thousand feet and out to about sixty miles and when they get to that point then they go to the en route centers so yknow downstairs there five different sectors so they split the uh area up into five different areas and uh yknow there are some sectors down there that get extremely busy and then sometimes it just like yknow you re just twiddling your thumbs it uh it like feast or famine yknow it not like steady like if you re working at meijer running the cash register it just kind of like steady it like you look at yknow you so you be like sitting at meijer and there no one in your line and then you turn your back and turn back around and there like seventy five waiting and they all want to go right now yknow and that how most airplanes are yknow they all they don think about anybody else they think i here why um why aren i first yknow so right uh well the problem is is um like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their business men there at eight a well an airport has so many runways and so many taxi ways and yknow like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and staying up there and hold while they re foo uh fi firing uh yknow shooting them in what they do is they uh like uh say going to hare they ll you hafta call for release times at these different airports and they will say well uh he can go right now but he can go like at twenty seven past the hour so he they know by looking at the entire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it not so much air traffic delays it airlines that cause it themself it like uh yknow like you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room at ten clock today well rather than say why don some of you come at ten and another group come at ten fifteen another group and we re all trying to do the same thing at once and it doesn work yknow you you can get you can only get so many people through that door and if you say well i gonna take five at a time well they can get in but if you say i taking five hundred at time it doesn work and so the airpla airlines always go well it the government and regulations and blah blah blah that why we re delayed and it really them themselves because they re right yknow because every businessman goes i want to be there at yknow and it doesn work that way yknow you can you just can physically do it i that i don know but uh yknow it like if if you and i are running an airline and everybody wants to get new york at eight a and you go at eight and i go at eight thirty who are they gonna fly so that i think that a problem too yknow everybody says well i don want to get there at eight thirty yknow so yeah the one thing they ve done is they ve put on bigger airplanes because it used to be yknow you like a uh say uh seven thirty seven would go from here to new york city and now it a seven fifty seven so that adds more seats so instead of because i wo when i first got there i couldn understand at when it was like christmas time or something it was just you drive up and the parking lot was just full of cars and you re like oh boy gonna be a really busy day and i would the same thing at port columbus yknow i i see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i like and i mentioned somebody i go where are the extra airplanes and they go they can add extra airplanes it they have certain routes they can do they just hafta put bigger airplanes on so he said yknow you ll see larger airplanes when it holiday time so they can put more people on so oh yeah yeah city council of dayton and had highlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that uh they would do something along that line um shoulda gone to columbus at the same time very interesting or just thousands is enough he didn have to have millions i don whether i ve ever pointed out this this out to you but he happened to be one of my uh fellow students down at ohio university now how he happened to learn all these things like he did i don i didn course he started out it he he i think the very first thing he was township trustee like paul was and then he also went and became the mayor of cincinnati and he was a very effective oh yeah he was a very very effective he was well liked there has been some serious consideration but no uh there were some a lot someone took up a petition and was urging to do it but he decided he did not want to devote that much time away from his uh his te television program oh he he quite a smart fellow really some of this conversation we ve had here uh has been influenced within our family uh we have ministers we have doctors we have lawyers we have uh farmers we have uh uh what else we got in we have profe professors yeah well well i as i mentioned a while ago i happen to have i a one of fifteen siblings the colonials yeah and he and had been deported well not in the immediate family going back like you did there i know there there a mur murderer in our family uh oh there have been horse thieves uh i going on back now i not thinking in terms of the current family but basically what i was talking about a while ago was current families somewhat current i was going then relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh uh but that was one comment she was talking about but then on the very very opposite extreme uh extreme opposite we talk about the love of the child from the day of birth and this may seem to be contradictory and i not quite sure how to address that because in a in in some some people would say now wait a minute you re talking out of out both sides your mouth the expression is how can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and and then over here you re saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution of a murderer okay okay i was about to say now on the record or off the re for people to read i think there enough other resources out there if somebody interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that um i know for me just because i have so many younger brothers and sisters my family everything i know how i ve got some pret pret what i feel are pretty good opinions about how to handle different things and i know that my mom always consults me yknow like my sister yknow she got her the in french which vanessa is just she this girl is almost creepy she so bright i mean she is thing is one of those things were she just doesn turn in her stuff yknow and if she twelve it it yknow my mom yknow she always tells people what should yknow what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it kinda neat that i ve been involved in a lot of a lot of the other kids that way um hum i don know i think you just kinda deal with it when it gets here though but yknow i think one of the things that you see people do a lot really bothers me is that whole thing about i think you ha just have to treat children like they re i just you have to respect them and you have to not not talk down to them and and that whole thing about yknow why can i do this well because i told you so yknow what kind of an is that even if your answer is i don know why you can do it it just makes me uncomfortable yknow that a more fair than because i the boss of you or something like that and i think if you respect your kids and and just kinda set boundaries with them yknow kinda try to be i don know that the way that the way my family always been and it always seems to work really well for us no yeah because it yeah aw hum is it hard to keep up with her um hum wow right look at her she so terrific watch her um hum um hum if yup we stay here probab probably mm hmm i went to private schools for long time hmm i don think that i would have them go to any i learned things like how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party that kind of stuff was a lot more focused i mean i didn even i don think anybody even taught me how to write in cursive other than my parents so i mean it was it was interesting i mean it was a lot more cultural kind of kinds of things you do a lot of things with nature and and that kind of was the seventies too so i mean you have to look at the what we re talking about but i ve i feel like i don see why i wouldn send them to public schools i mean obviously that a long ways off um i guess i imagine i would be teaching in public school so hopefully i could try to get them where i was but i don know i mean maybe i don is that i don even know if is dublin really better than columbus public or i think they ve got more money i don know if that necessarily makes them a better school um i think a lot of it is is is really what as far as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it yknow my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and and they took advanced a classes and they worked real hard and and they ve got i think that they have options that you really get a lot out of it if that something you want to do and i think as long as you re involved with the school makes and just keep an eye on what going on then you re really gonna get out of it what you need to um hum really um hum yeah both my whole family all graduated megan was first in her class joe ranked first my brother philips ra i uh was not yknow they re all they re all straight four por that straight four point kids but it true yknow and and they really my mom really has work worked with them to make sure that that they get into some programs that they need and they re some things now i think that they re developing that they didn have before some different types of of courses and those types of things so um hum yeah yeah um hum well um my family he so funny because my parents are so you would never put them together now yknow back then yknow my well you saw my mo no you didn see her you she cute she got a little hair cut she all like but um she is she wonderful but bu back then they were there was the sixties and they were hippies and yknow my moms got long jet black hair and they re wearing their army outfits and they re whatever yknow everybody got bellbottoms and my dads got long hair down to here and everything so they lived like seventeenth avenue for a while and we lived um like i said on summit until i was about three years and then they split up for a little bit and got back together and my mom and i lived some place on campus in just a little one room apartment it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends which which was which great for me i mean everybo my dad and i would do fun my mom and i would do fun stuff and it and i don don i never remember it being negative i it being it a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they weren together because they all both gave me a lot of attention but um i think i maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village and we stayed there for a while and then she met my step when i was about like six years old i think and then they moved up uh to clintonville about when i was about eight now my dad lives up in clintonville too so yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spent the weekends with my dad and i spent the week with them so and it was it was neat though because pete was my mom was twenty nine and pete was eighteen and so pete was just like some who liked to play yknow we go fly kites and do all this fun stuff and but um i was i i was interested in uh seeing uh coleman be elected yes because uh she a republican uh i used to work with not directly but indirectly so i certainly didn want to be elected she was the rudest woman yeah i would she was like a uh community liaison uh with our corporation so i was a supervisor on my job and sometimes i would have very very difficult uh clients that i need advice from her on how to yknow go about working with them and um sh i would call her and she would um uh just be really rude not helpful um hum um hum um hum well you you had a ha had a good reason be bothered uh coleman yknow he had a good uh record yknow on the council and that kind of thing so yknow he democrat yknow like yknow i said well ok yknow give him a shot anything but because i thought yknow basically the city been ran pretty well basically yknow as far as cities are right the mall issue well i felt that uh yknow polaris mall would be good for the city uh even though i wanted yknow northland mall to stay there that a seemed to be the big issue yknow with northland mall but uh yknow i knew that uh they already made that promise and there a lot of businesses that could move out of that area yknow and half those taxes come to columbus even if a business is in westerville half the tak the employees tax are going to um westerville and half are coming columbus yeah um yknow i felt like yknow the polaris mall would benefit columbus and um all all the way around yknow uh as far as uh yknow what was going on with that jacobs coming here and running all that advertising about northland mall and everything um i can understand yknow the residents of northland uh wanting their mall to remain but i didn feel like yknow that had anything do with polaris being built see i live close to uh that would be the closest mall to me is northland it convenient for me but uh then there a lot yknow that they could do with that mall too that might make me even ga gonna wanna go there more if they oh it has yknow your basic uh lazarus which i like to go to lazarus and sears and penny and uh no i wouldn want to drive to polaris to go to those stores but if they made some outlets over there yknow that i be happy with that uh there just a lot of smaller stores yknow like victoria secrets and bookstores and toy stores and athletic wear stores um lot those i don even go to got some kiosks set up outside yknow with little the little carts with different little things they sell just like your basic kind of mall i don go to city center too much although i like it being there if i want to go to it yeah yeah because the traffic but see where i live i could get on the bus if i just wanted to go downtown real bad yeah yeah stops in front of my house yeah i like that and do like that i don get on it but i mean it there yknow it been good for my son uh being here at the university well he uses it when he has like car problems or something he tends to like to drive his own car do yknow they have to park so far away uh huh uh huh yeah i don know what he pey pays but i know that he clear out over off of olentangy river road and has to take like a bus in um hum uh huh yeah so that where he always parked which made a little inconvenient when he lived in the uh the twin towers in the dorm because if i needed him to come home or something yknow well i don know i gotta get it get to my car some kind of way yknow where i live now i ve lived there for eleven years yeah quite a bit yeah i ve seen columbus grow from the for from the time i ve yknow lived here as a child yknow uh one sixty one yknow dublin granville road yknow i can remember when that was all country yknow and when i came back here i i moved uh to kentucky i came back here um i say uh nineteen seventy three one sixty one was like yknow all new and this a place i wanna live yknow all the cool apartments are on one sixty one all the great restaurants and everything so that where i lived uh yknow now that just like they consider that like urban an urban area yeah i i i loved one sixty one i loved around there i loved all those cool restaurants and everything well yi it not that there been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop and come back in because see this is a great area around here to live and people yknow like in clintonville realize that but then when get a little more over where i am my daughter was horrified yknow that i wanted to buy a house over there but i was single yknow with limited money and i live in a nice neighborhood i ve lived there for eleven years i ve never had any trouble whatsoever and uh the bus is right there and yknow the only thing that bothers me is if i wanna yknow go to a grocery store gotta go yknow over to high street yknow to clintonville yknow to the big bear or i gotta drive yknow further north so there not any like really good businesses right around where i live that the only thing so i think they need to come in yknow redo yknow get the downtown going when i was a kid i loved to go downtown yknow that was like the coolest we would uh ride the bus we lived uh right around here on sixteenth avenue i appreciate your opinions but were you asking did you have we seen a change in the politicians and through our lifetime was that particularly your point yeah okay okay i don i i i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh were not a consideration in the in oh i say probably my first thirty maybe even forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed now that not necessarily his opinion so i trying to make a point there he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had uh uh various people within his community or whether whether you re talking about a township or a county state whatever it may be and yes uh uh then perhaps slowly then i think the finances came into play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of today and i ll leave out this thi the last two years it because it because it rather sh specific specific right now but uh going back to two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on the uh national level but i seeing it even on local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there uh tell hey come on we ll go to dinner we ll go do this and we ll do this and do this just uh just barely barely breaking the barrier but not breaking the law uh so yes very definitely progressively has changed which one of them old blue eyes that right uh huh well don know that that a cause uh a it they as a uh and this was kind of a happenstance it occ this occurred as a result of a very major world war uh so in in terms of them causing it thi there it was there was a happenstance and and part of this mass communication we re talking about uh began with them and yes they are a major influence because we were talking about numbers and you re talking about uh a grezha a greater inter communication i like to go back one step where we re talking about when i made mention that three doors down you don even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that as an individual communication we are nearing zero in terms of global mass communication to everybody wi inner personal communications that the key in my opinion personal versus inner personal communications eh and it zero over here and we re almost a hundred percent over here but when we re in this inner personal or global or massive whichever term is the most appropriate um john doe who speak here he hasn the faintest idea who jane doe is over here on the personal it used to be that yeah you knew who this person rize right was over here that jane doe that lives in that third house and she married henry jackson don you remember old henry well henry was the guy that lived way over there on the other side of town mass communications as it is today they haven the faintest idea of where jane came from or where henry jackson or where old jh whoever it was lived over there i so i think uh the th i have i you must need to distinguish between the personal inner personal relationship so maybe i digress too far there or who the next door neighbor is one two three four okay um hum where you from oh really hm okay well ts call me rachel and i twenty i ve got a two year old son he just had his birthday um the thirty first so and i live by myself in a house and i work um at in the accounting department it in the accounting department um west side off of road yeah yeah yep yeah yeah i not married i single i from here columbus ohio yeah yep i graduated from brookhaven off of coral um by northland mall i ho well i hope they keep it i mean that is a neighborhood mall and i mean i don think they should get rid of it for polaris thing but yknow there plenty of malls to go to that the case it not a big deal to me to tell you the truth no actually i live i live closer i live east more but northland mall is where i do go shopping um hum yeah all my family still lives around me pretty much yeah yeah yeah hi actually his his dad mother babysits yeah oh yeah yeah i don think they get the attention they need but i don think it bad i don think it bad because he did go to a day care when he was little before his grandmother started watching him and um um i mean it yknow you you re got people you don know watching your kid and that kinda scary but yknow you gotta check things out first before you put your kid anywhere yeah uh yeah for them to go to a dayc yeah make i would think he ll for them to interact with the kids more yeah but whe where he goes there he got ill cousins and stuff there with him so yeah he not getting that i don think he getting that learning he he more his uh that his grandmother yknow watching him and yknow i that she would like do more of the learning things that the day cares do do yknow but i guess yeah i i yknow get on her to make sure she sits down and reads with him yknow because i do put when i get home with him i yknow sit down do his a one two threes but he loves to read books so i try to get her to do that inthed of just let them play all day and just yknow nope she that a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much yknow yeah yeah no no well i mean as i mean like i was saying i he at the ages where he needs to yknow start learning things and she just does not do that i and that probably the way she raised her kids but no we have totally different opinions about everything period because they re from um a different they re from the virgin islands yeah so they re like not american ways yknow but yeah i in discipline she not she not as shirk as i am i don i don allow no hitting no yknow and she kind of neg lets it get away she lets him be a little rough because he a boy but i don hm no they re all boys they re all boys there so when i pick him up from there he out of hand a little bit and i ve gotta get him back yknow you re with mommy now you ve got to behave settle down well i work i work part time kind of because uh i worked full time when he was uh yknow one and i didn uh i felt like um the babysitters or yknow whoever saw him more than i did and that re because i love my son more then anything in the world and i felt like he needed me yknow so i went down to part time i struggling more but i rather see my son have me yknow around more than somebody else yep it is i know um hum i know mm hmm no ye i feel funny that i i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but yknow it just just didn work out yknow i was his father for like nine years since i was sixteen he just didn grow up once we had him he didn change like i changed and so well i grew up with just my mom there she had four kids and i was a very quiet and did very well in school yknow my older sister was a different case she was a little badder but it it yknow as long as you have a good parent to yknow i think that really all that matters because my mom was my mother and father she she did very well as much as she could yknow we were poor but we managed no huh um yes i i i just don i not comfortable with another man being around my son like that so i mean if i dated that mean yknow i taking it i just i don know haven felt i ve went out a couple times but i won let it get serious or yknow no staying the night nothing like that goes on and i ve got friends that do that and i i don i don feel right i don want to see my kid seeing all these different guys coming around and stuff that no way huh uh um hum yeah yep uh huh okay oh i just i matured i um didn do stupid things i did that yknow um i don go out much like i used to i don go out hardly ever if i go out yknow it just to get out for a minute yknow might have a drink but i don get i don get drunk because i always go pick up my son usually before i go home um i just i don know i yknow when i was a teenager because i a i had him when i was twenty one and i mean i just pretty much became a home body i a home body now i don go out i don take my kid places and drop him off he with me all the time i don run around the place we re at home when i come home from work he at home with me we don we he goes to bed at eight and i go to bed by ten and it just yknow it just like yeah um hum yeah yeah if it a nice day on the weekends i there were things out but there nothing like what they have today you know the small little hand guns and things like that they re real easy carryable and concealable i mean like you know back in the sixties stuff like that i mean they had switchblades things like yeah i mean i mean there really nothing too different exactly yeah um i sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun they ll get a gun it doesn matter what they do to try to make it so people can get their hands on guns they re basically always gonna be around and people are always gonna get them if they want them i think more what they need to do is in strict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really don get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism you re still serving jail time and you get you get pretty badly punished for it i mean some cases they ll even chain you up and beat you in public for it um i think not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way that there be a much less problem with it um i think just the fact that the jails are so over crowded now that they know that they re gonna get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you re you re not even gonna get thirty days in jail and you re gonna be let go i mean that an awfully small price to pay for just carrying around a gun and shooting someone um hum yeah yeah um i don really know honestly i mean it definitely careless nature and definitely something has to be done to em but at the same time it not like they had the intent to do it so i can say anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalties that you run into for that um but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun but i mean that just sort of the curious nature of kids i mean they obviously they re gonna get into stuff and things like that and i mean it not always the parent fault i mean i kn there are a lot of people i mean i think just in the news a few weeks ago they had a shooting that happened couple of years ago and they just came to a verdict on it and the parent like left in a top drawer of a tool shed that was locked and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked it and he ended up shooting himself with it i mean as far as that goes i mean there really nothing more he could do i mean yeah i mean it just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously they re gonna be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i don know to what degree that they should go with it nothing serious no um not really i mean i ve been with a few people that have just i mean just randomly gotten kind of jumped i mean they didn steal anything they just beat them up for no reason or what not but i mean it was nothing too serious or violent i mean they didn like pull out any weapon or anything like that it was just a fistfight yeah happened sometime um probably would ve been my ow my freshman year in high school um we were just walking down high street and i guess we were wrong place at the wrong time and some people were like yelling stuff and we couldn make out what they were saying and one of my friends was like what you say and he took that as like a threat or something like walked over and just picking a fight with him just to beat him up but um they probably would ve been um about seniors in high school or so juniors or seniors in high school i mean it wasn anything too serious it was just more i guess a testosterone trip or something oh definitely yeah like i said parts no different uh um it probably would be worse i mean actually just wait for my last experiments i heard couple people talking about it they were talking about it yeah um and i can say there are some drugs that i don really consider to be too threatening or that i really too worried about people using um like i mean just the whole idea with marijuana things like that i mean it doesn really bother me so much i mean cigarettes and alcohol basically do the same thing it does and i mean those are legal obviously um obviously things like once you start getting into cocaine things like that those are a little bit more serious and obviously a lot more dangerous and i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with the bigger drugs once you get it to like college or whatever as back into gr grade into high school um i ve been to parties and things like that where people were shooting up with like heroin and things like that um and i mean that pretty i don know extreme yeah um so i mean it definitely i would say this more serious drugs are definitely much more widely used once you get into college um but i mean as far as like the pot and just things like that i mean i can say i see any difference between here and high school ecstasy is the drug i ve been hearing about a a lot the past like year or two and it definitely something that grown just like almost out of control um it pretty dangerous drug i would say for the most part um not so much the getting high part of it but just what goes into it uh like i know one of the poisons used in it is like rat poison or something like that i mean just obviously the idea of putting rat poison into you when it meant to kill a rat obviously seems pretty dangerous um hum yeah yeah yeah um ecstasy yes there are a few people that i know that use it like on a fairly regular basis even um i mean nothing happened to them and i mean like i said the high getting high part of it isn so much of the problem it just what goes into it um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they wanna take the risks obviously they know the risks and what goes into it and like i said i mean it doesn really hurt anyone the high part of it um i mean basically all they do is sit on the couch and and smile and laugh at basically anything that said for four or five hours and i mean that about it but ah i have i ve have uh and yknow there kids in the neighborhood and the grownups talk and i i talk to the kids too i there a a girl that lives next door who i we talk a lot she just started at um everett the uh arts middle school boy i yknow i i don not having kids and then yknow not being that close to it it hard to know i mean i ve always i ve always thought that that um what their friends did and what they what they were exposed to at home had as much influence as as anything that that the school could do but i know the school school is a very powerful force in a kid life yknow i mean it is a kid life yeah with tha that no i no i am definitely in favor of that i mean yes it the i it the parents is the parent is supposed to do it and one would hope that the parent would get there before before the health class did but if the parent isn gonna get there this is the only way they re ever gonna find um hum i i think it is because uh when i i was a sophomore in high school before it dawned on me that tab a and slot had any to the stuff that we were learning with the charts and the diagrams and um but i think kids are a lot more aware now from because of what they re exposed to yknow in movies and everything yknow just tv just daily life um either they re a lot more aware they they have i they go into it with a lot of of uh myths and misapprehensions but they definitely have thoughts about it and and i think they i think they need to i well yknow i don i don see how we can say i i mean we can refuse to to see certain classes of movies or or watch certain classes of shows but i yknow without getting into that first amendment thing i can yknow i don see how we can have a code of conduct yeah yeah boy i don know i i yknow i ve never seen it happen in in my lifetime yknow so i do don i don know if it could be but then of course it can go on the same way forev yknow it can keep i don think the weather girl yeah yeah we well it it it makes me wonder because um i don i don see a lot of movies so a lot of this is yknow just from reading reviews and stuff but it seems like yknow last last year two explosions would do the job this year you gotta have five explosions and two car chases and and mutilated bodies yknow it it just seems like it it you need more and more sensationalism to sell your to sell your product and uh it scary it it really hard to do to to talk about morals um without bringing uh yknow religious background or something into it i think i think ah the way the schools should approach it is if you get pregnant it gonna ruin your life so you don want to do that do you yknow sort of thing boy that a that a really tough one i hadn i hadn thought about that and and high school kids are so touchy about i mean about touchy about sexual identity and and so likely th that yknow so insecure in their own that they re really likely to come down hard on somebody who has a has a different orientation and i do don i don know i don know um hum yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you can ignore it i mean because be yknow because that something else when i was in high school i don don think i knew the word but um now everyb everybody knows anybody who a little bit different is likely to be called a faggot and and so it better if you can diffuse that but i wouldn boy i wouldn know how to approach it i mean i think it should be approached but i wouldn have a clue yeah yeah yeah yeah i think i think they should um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your orientation that you can be converted to homosexuality and i personally don believe that so it i yknow i not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that where this comefmi comes comes from but since i think they re wrong i think it should be my way and i think i think yknow th i think the material should be there i think it sh yknow dealt with in a calm and reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids yeah yeah i i think i think it i think it fair i think it should be that domestic partners should be should be covered i think there should probably be some uh yknow some some restrictions there should be some level of and a lot more um different suburbs so maybe it it going and becoming a little wealthier and i don think it really i don think it really affected me tha i mean obviously there more places to go shopping or to or you there more traffic laugh don particularly care much for um but don think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it it was where you went to school with the people once at least once i went to highschool i went to public school um and you kinda knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that still that still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in um so i don thing me personally other than other than the fact that maybe there a couple more things to do there bigger more comfortable movie theaters and and that kinda stuff hasn really affected me and i can say that that maybe if if it would have stayed small maybe could notice some kind of a difference that way but i never i haven noticed anything right i can see that i yknow uh like i said for me i kind of i kinda stay where i am so it not that i really travel into some of those other areas more so i mean well it doesn really affect me personally maybe that i don know maybe should feel guilty about but but um hum right right right i think there uh you they re so many small communities like even is really a obviously its own its own little community and then you ve got yknow dublin and they ve got their own parades and their own different things so i agree i mean i think that that you there really is a lot of things to do in our own individual area that i can see somebody from dublin going over to the west side to do yknow what i don and uh maybe also i feel safer where i live too and and that something that an issue for me i know when i do travel down cleveland avenue it makes me it does it makes me nervous so i just kinda stay away from that um i don i don wanna get shot um hum yeah um hum yeah well it it kinda hard when you ve got your limited choices here yknow some of it some of the issues i thought were kind of important but when you re looking at the mayorial candidates did you watch that debate oh was horrible it was a because you watch it and you think oh my god i don want either of these people i mean dod dorothy peters obviously been around for a really long time and i uh i would tip i my views are typically a little bit more democratic but i not too say that i certainly wouldn vote um for the person that i thought would do the best job but when you look at coleman he thi thinks there was a point where they sai said they asked a yes or no question and neither one of these folks could it yes or no and they re going just answer yes or no they ll tell you well i think i stated my point very clearly when i was no the answer is yes or is it was it was um healthcare living partners um it a simple question yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it just drives me nuts that yknow and i know that that from a stand point you don wanna you don wanna shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like the damn it yknow if you re running for office you should just just be up front just say how you feel yknow because i just think it looks so awful when you can you can even admit to what what you re opinion is yknow and it just i think that that happens so often there are too many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when you re talking circles around yourself but you never say anything so that that frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i don want either one of these people there should be a none of the above yknow if there was that option i sure a lot mo um hum really yknow i agree i mean none of the above you go and i think a lot more people would certainly go out they would vote for none of the above and they we can have some more candidates i think that would be perfect i think it would well i think it true don vote because you think i don want either one of these people what does it matter who cares so yknow people just think there no really no point to even vote it too bad really is hum transportation issue that was kind of a i thought that rail system looked kinda cool yknow which is which is kinda tough the question is do we wanna spend the money on it and will people actually use it um i think a lot of it goes back down to traffic and you re like yknow people driving both ways and i think if people are actu if they re gonna make it so people are actually gonna it i think i probably a pretty good thing to have and i voted for which i know jason i can believe you re gonna do that yeah and i i just i guess i just felt like i don know it it kinda mea i don i just think that that kinda neat and if you re looking at traffic and and i could see if i was going downtown and coming back the amount of money that you pay to park downtown is outrageous um even ju just having takes i know when it when it was snowing because i worked on worked on front street and where i would come fro i live on bethel road which is i take bethel to three fifteen down through downtown and it would take me an hour and forty five minutes in the snow to get down there and if i could if i could jump on this rail system and it would take me fifteen minutes and i wouldn have to pay fifty dollars a month for parking why not do that and all there also the whole pollution thing and and those types of things so i thought that was really um hum really and people use do people use them um hum hum uh huh um hum wow that great right right um hum that great to do that yeah and i think there a whole bunch of people that just don wanna spend any extra money on anything we re already paying for enough things you don wanna do this i don know how that even um hum but i don understand is this with the construction they start everywhere yknow you think that you would start one area you put a whole bunch of people and they work real fast and they get that done and then they move on but it like every single place in city got like four guys working you think what the hell you doing over there really then the people that are doing you think why do you why are we hiring these guys yknow what are they what are they well they have yeah it projected like six years to take place to finish some of these projects own real well i know we drove through georgia you actually see people working on the road there a whole bunch of people and they re all out there working yknow and you get to ohio there that i don know something on david letterman had a picture of this and i think i ve seen it before that big sign that says your tax dollars at yknow and there the construction guy smoking a cigarette leaning up against the sign kinda thing like it was a kinda funny well i mean no i i just think that typically you see a lot of peop lot of places that are that are under construction not very many people working there um hum what a alright um we ll i ve lived in columbus all my life never can say i ever really leave too often um i have a brother sister uh obviously parents they re divorced i live with my mom um i live up around the beechwold area uh really as far as ohio state goes i a freshman here uh just started winter quarter um i like it for the most part it little bit much much different actually than high school was and that kind of surprised me just all the sorts of changes and th things like that going on but other than that i mean i seem to like it i mean it definitely changes for the better it a lot more just free i mean i get to do whatever you want i mean there no one watching over you saying what you have to do all the time and everything like that um i am signed up for architecture right now which i like architecture but i think there probably more time into it than i ready to actually commit into it and so i think i ll probably end up changing i don know what to it probably be more towards the education line um just i mean i like everything about architecture i mean that actually what i do as a job right now i mean i like building things i like adding on a bedroom and a bathroom onto a house but it just more time consuming than i think i ready to put into it um yes and no i mean in high school it was a bunch of little things here it not so much a lot of things it it major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming yeah exactly which is one of the things i ran into architecture where i mean we only had yknow one or two papers we had to write but there were one or two eight or nine page papers about a building that you had to go put hours worth of research into and then sketch and and it was just exactly yeah um actually i guess it something that always started sort of been there always been real big on just building things mean been real big hands on and last summer i helped my dad uh put a garage onto his house um like i mean literally i mean we poured the foundation and everything like build everything up from there and it turned out really well and i mean it was really fun to do i mean it i liked it a lot better than being stuck inside all the time and just ya know sort of doing the same old same old everyday there it was always something different i have to be outside and it was just a lot easier to do um actually it more it almost actually turned into like a self business um like i said it started out with my dad and then people would ask me what i was doing i tell them they be like oh i have some things around the house that need to be done and so i go there and they tell people and i get more people asking me for that and i mean it turns out pretty nice i making about ten or eleven bucks an hour and i mean it basically any time i have free i mean it not like i have a set schedule of when i have to work things like that it just whenever i feel like i have to do it i do it so um actually oddly enough that what i putting in one of the bathrooms right now is a jacuzzi um that not really too hard but the hardest thing to do is electrical work like it just because it more intimidating than it is difficult exactly getting getting electrocuted or something yeah that just doesn appeal to me too much but i mean it really not too difficult i mean as long as you re careful and think about things i mean it pretty easy to do yeah we lived um we moved about five or six years ago um and the house we had before was some big like eighty ninety year old house and i mean obviously it needed a lot of repairs because it pretty old and there were just things that he do and i guess just picking up watching him seeing what he would do that where it took me to and it just sort of sparked an interest in me i guess and it just grew from there yeah yeah i ve run into that a lot i think part of it was the high school i went to i mean i ve gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i ve run into a lot more of the wealthier type people who either just don have time or don have the interest and just pay people to do it and as a result like there are kids my age and stuff like that that i ve talked to i mean they have no idea what going on which i mean isn necessarily a bad thing but i mean it something that definitely noticeable in there oh did you um hum oh yeah it oh yeah yeah plus i mean you save a lot of money too i mean kind of i ve seen a few of like infomercials on stuff like that um but i can say anything too serious has come up from it um i mean i that definitely a possibility for career wise down the road but um i don know i ll have to see sort of where takes me i went for grade school and for high school um that is on road like ninety nine east road or something like that uh it wasn wasn anything too huge i think it had about twelve hundred people in it or so um it i mean it was pretty good place i mean looking back on it i remembered a lot better than when i was actually there obviously i mean it was just something that just i mean you don really appreciate it until you ve gone through it and then remember back on it yeah um i don really think there any huge difference um i can say from what i ve seen the people that went to the catholic schools um they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here um and i definitely i mean i ve think i went to like kindergarten in the public school so i don really know too much about like the kind of curriculums and things that they had to do but i know i mean as far as going to a lot of the stuff like in math and things like that that i doing now is stuff i already covered in high school so i already have a basis for it um so i think that part definitely helps whereas most of my other friends you know they re kind of lost they don know exactly what they re doing um where like said i ve already done all the stuff that we re doing now and know how to go about it and how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest differences just really the amount of education you get and the um that was part of the process there to how to work work and work up there too with people but if we could just share more i would be a lot happier mm yeah i hope we re gonna get there moh yeah yeah yeah yeah it gonna have to be from the bottom up i think and everybody keeps and i ge i just getting a kick out of all the advertisements and everything they re coming with two thousand on it well i hoping people are making a big deal and making a big advertisement and selling a lot of stuff because of it but i hoping that it does mean peop since people are so focused on it does mean a shift in consciousness i hope uh two i don know what that really stands for i have to think of some words there but yknow i hope uh since everybody is just making it into a big deal that maybe it will be a big deal yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah there always people out there actually i wore out i sort of wore out um that and um just oh there were two reasons i left one i was getting exhausted and uh it was just so demanding and we didn know as a community how to let uh up so i had had i had to withdraw another thing was i very into um metaphysics and studying and meditating we had no time whatsoever everybody was in there um that one disagreement i have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in january so there always people coming for four or five days and you have to explain everything in life to them in four or five and plus we uh lived in um a a rural setting where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant and a hardware and had a mail route and then we had all these visitors and then we and then we uh made our own bread and we uh milked a cow and so it just plain hard physical work plus all the mental um stuff of dealing with people really big questions it wa it was yknow so that the reason i had to quit is was like if i could leave this situation for a month or six weeks and get caught up within myself i would have been okay but that wasn how it worked so had to to pull back from it uh uh uh i have one daughter thirty six years old she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren um hum yeah um hum yeah no not often uh my daughter has a very um intense life and uh so um i don see them near as often as i like right we just do a one day thing because it fairly easy to drive to toledo so i go real early in the morning and uh spend six or seven hours with them and then come back and or she does the same thing she comes down here and we just do the one thi day thing now because of the children she worries about the children and blah blah blah blah you know it better to stick home so i know what they re doing and everything but i don i not the old fashioned grandmother um i like to be yknow but she lives i keep telling her i wish she move down here but i not moving to i don like toledo uh i don know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but um but it not that i it i don like it as well as columbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university um hum i ve given you plenty of opinions haven i i ve just loaded them on you okay i i just have a question is do you is this a research project for a private organization or is it uh huh um hum okay i bet i ll go home and i ll wonder and wonder and wonder about this um hum now that was up to age eighteen to or there about to i think that the you said get back to the very beginning of the birth and up to kindergarten so forth we i that that the family but uh i think that we in our educational program we really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values uh but but but good values i won given whether they re old or new but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system uh starting in the elementary right on up to college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses uh that that devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and uh assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values um i could even so go so far as to saying chemistry or botany or psychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and but the i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value uh and that will help them permeate the entire society and but it got to start back here in the first and i think just uh don i just go back and copy cat something she said uh picking up that bay picking up that child and cuddling it um and having having that baby touch your skin and uh and uh uh teaching how what love is uh uh you don necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother little brother and the little sister all of those now you say teach that well my god didn they know that when they first came into this classroom no not today not today i i dare say that uh the vast majority and i mean above fifty well above fifty percent when i say that i not being arbitrary um students in high school today probably haven had their mother or their father truly hold them and hug them rather than just saying hi johnny bye see you tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warmth of the body uh hear the conversation quietly rather than uh hearing okay time to get out of here you know with a vigorous saying but with pleasant sort of remark these kind i can elaborah i could write a whole book on that on this on answer your que ers uh but it these kinds of things are very elementary really they re very elementary i guess to our age group but maybe not so sure uh maybe the baby boomers that wouldn be elementary at all uh going back to your question about the baby boomers i still think they were i don think they re causing them but then i think it was a happenstance uh with that group with a massive group variant my name is okay what department oh just was going down like oh i tightened this good it like it falling i oh it there it can go cool perfect okay okay uh my name is am an undergrad double major in german and history currently working on a senior honors thesis in history i will be graduating next quarter after a grand total of six years as an undergrad an impressive uh somewhat disturbing six years as an undergrad ah i live in german village uh i like it here grew up here like it here uh i think of it as a big city having been to other big cities it feels more like that then small towns which i ve also been to of course but my thesis is on the sudeten germans those are the germans who lived in czechoslovakia uh before the second world war and uh specifically i looking at how they perceived their condition switching from being part of the austro hungarian empire uh and the germans being sort of the uh the majority uh even though they weren the majority but sort of the the uh the the master nation within the austro hungarian empire to becoming uh mit a minority within czechoslovakia ah i ve always had an interest in german history and also in eastern european history and i mean it seemed to be a natural way that i could tie those two together for a thesis german yeah all right well as most people don like to hear uh relatives and stuff i taking a year off and then ah abtending grad school uh i plan at this point to pursue history to the level ah anything of course can happen but that my plan uh relax uh get a a dead end job that doesn come home with me uh try and pay off my debt and maybe make a little bit so i i i uh grad school yeah but also enjoy all the things i didn get to do uh while working on this thesis this is be project that has been ongoing for about a year and i ve voluntarily given up a lot of things i like to do and i looking forward to catching up uh music uh painting uh that sort of thing yeah just having fun yes i have several times um well one of the things i doing is i applying for a number of research grants to go to germany continue my research so hopefully i ll get one of those um i think i in pretty good shape to get one of those so uh that that might cause me to put off grad school for a year but i don think the grad schools will mind if i if they have so someone who gets a grant who already planning to go to their school so yeah so yeah not too much uh i was planning on i hadn always planned on taking a year off but getting into the research uh ha like one of the things i sacrificed was looking into grad schools and applying to grad school this past year so yeah so uh i mean i i like to go here it one of my choices cause i like the faculty and i like the program but uh uh i plan to spend the next couple months well the first few months after i graduate looking at other schools oh yeah yeah take care of that soon okay cool ah right um i would like to teach um mm the the field is particularly saturated right now so i not holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean i like to think that i could distinguish myself within the field and get a job but i mean right now those jobs simply are not available so uh i approaching things like whatever happens happens i gonna pursue my interests and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career plans after i finish my schooling oh yeah um hum um i got into painting somewhat recently uh i ve always done a lot of art uh my mom is an elementary school art teacher so i was always exposed to art as child uh did pretty good too i never got into painting it was mainly drawing that kind of thing and just uh yeah three or four years ago i thought i gonna learn how to paint and i learned how to paint and i like painting so um most of my paintings uh uh thi this is gonna sound funny most of my paintings are of uh images from star wars now this most of my paintings were completed uh before uh like nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six before it came back out it was more of a thing like images from my childhood coming back out and now it suddenly uh you hear about it more often so that why i a little funny but used to be impressed like i paint star wars i paint sesame street or something i don paint ses sesame street just something from childhood that i paint and now it somewhat mainstream so it sounds a little funny i also i ve painted a cou couple of portraits pretty happy with of some friends i have done a self portrait um that kind of thing okay um hum um ye kind of uh i mean it was something i was really into uh until i don know maybe about fourth or fifth grade at which point things sort of switched to yknow like i don know like killer robots or something like transformers that kind of thing uh in high school i uh i don know i think i cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys i like star wars is fun i gonna watch star wars more often i had them on tape so i started watching them and got i don wanna say into it because i know people who are really into it i pretty into it but it not the same kind of thing i don think but back when i started doing the the painting uh i i graduated from high school in ninety four just to put things in a little perspective uh so something like my first couple years of college uh from sort of the second half of high school to my first couple years of college i was just sort of just i don know i liked the story um oh that almost as bad as rosie cozy i have a friend who her she not really a friend she was a teacher when i was in college her name was mrs cozy and she got pregnant she said everybody said she came in one day and said it a girl it a girl i found out it a girl what re you gonna name her rosie rosie cozy you ve got to be kidding she said i just putting you on oh my sister last name is goodnight and when she had her first little girl she said she was gonna name her dawn ann goodnight but she didn she didn telling you some people go nuts with the name i worked down at children hospital when i was in college uh at the ear nose and throat outpatient clinic couple summers and i telling you i to put some names on the books like you wouldn believe ima darling that was her name ima darling and there was a little boy named ephraim zimbalist junior coca cola franklin i supposed to fit that in a space like that oh i telling you my husband lived in a town a small town in southern ohio where the dentists in town were three brothers and they were named pain pain and pain dentists and it was a i there some funny name stories out there boy but people just go nuts with their kids names i just like would you want to do why you do that to that kid carol harold well when you get into the black population you sometimes see some names i uh actually read a story in some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she didn know what she had twins and she didn know what to name them and she run out of names that she liked so they brought her um lunch in to her and the nurse jokingly said or the aid or something why don you just pick couple of names off the menu so she named them lemonjello and orangello lemon jello orange jello she picked lemon jello orange jello and turned them into lemonjello and orangello denise and denephew but um um one time i i read somewhere that a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they ve already named her look femalee or shanse whatever femalee female so that was her name femalee she thought boy they re nice in this country they even named my baby for me people are so stupid yeah i do aren they i ve seen every name eight after twenty years of you ve spelled every name you ve read every name you ve written every name practically there aren any that you haven heard of remember a time when i was brand new teacher i was maybe fifth or sixth year of teaching that still pretty new this john i said john what your last name he said guess i said i don feel like guessing tell me your last name he said guess i said john i want to know your last name and he said i like oh sorry thank you oh gosh he just kept saying guess guess guess and i kept saying i don want to guess this is the first day of got school i lots of stuff to do we don have time to play guessing games i said spell your last name he said talk about feeling stupid oh yeah i sure oh yeah i heard something the other day that really really upset me i was at um this convention downtown the convention center and uh one of the ladies that was presenting one of the workshops is a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear your writing to a person who in the eighth grade she said you know what they say now and i raised my hand and said sixth she said fourth gear your writing for a fourth grader and everyone will that you everymbody that gonna read the memo will be able to read well doesn have any words in it like exacerbate or undoubtedly i tell you that but that yknow that a sign that that not only are we doing the dumbing down of jobs doing the dumbing down of schools reader digest used to write their digest on the eighth grade level and they now write it on the sixth grade level newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level for the general public it just either we re getting more and more kids that aren learning to read or um kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that well i read one article that said that because kids sit in front of a television set from the time they re born until they re five when they come to kindergarten they don participate they want to sit back and be entertained and they re expecting you to do all this stuff and they re just gonna watch and they have to become an active learner and they have to be taught how to participate mm not so much when i was teaching it because i think when i was teaching it that was kind of before all the moms went to work but since all the moms have gone to work and let the tv become the electronic babysitter and the other thing that happening is kids do not know things now that you expect them to know like because their moms aren reading to them like they don know who winnie the pooh is or they don know who eyor or you say something to a kid about um three blind mice or yknow the things that we learned when we were kids because our mom taught them or we learned them at church in a game or something they all look at you like christopher robin who that piglet who that yknow these there a whole generation of kids now whose moms did not stay home and read to them and all that fairy tale stuff and nursery rhyme stuff they don have a clue what you re talking about well some of them are i guess depending on where they go but i had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid she only has maybe one or two kids in her whole class that hasn gone to preschool or daycare and she said it takes that kid up till christmas to catch up with the things the other kids come in already knowing that how far behind they are used to be in kindergarten you were expected to know your colors and your name and your address you didn even have to write it it you just had to know how to say it and your phone number and um recognize the color words and know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills and that was about they expected you to play cooperatively and that about all they expect you to know now in kindergarten they expected you to know all that plus by the time you get to first grade you re supposed to have in oh and the numbers you used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could uh say them in order and recognize them you didn even have to know how to spell the word or write them down now they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred you re supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade yknow you have to be a good example i mean if you if you re just that for your then that all they yknow you might not always do the right things or say the right things but if you re taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the right then think that the best you can do for them well uh yeah i think it real important to really good uh get a good feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they don um then it not ever going to work because because there always gonna be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it real important and there no age limit on that to when you really feel about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we do have a mutual thing and young people their yknow there so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get yknow off course and everything else and and then it doesn stay the same i mean it all exciting and and all that and then it yknow i think it kind of oh yeah i was never gonna get married again i had my house my kids yknow i had already done that i was financially secure and i didn i wasn even looking one of my best friends though at the time uh she saw this guy she iy he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing and i talked to this girl every day and she like oh you have to meet him you have to meet him i was like oh yknow call me tomorrow i don want meet anybody so it took a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were she was right i mean uh we were like inseparable from probably of two weeks after we met we just i ve haven been without him so yeah and it been five years this year that we ve been married and uh close to seven that i ve known him so and it still just as exciting it still just as good and yeah he amazes me everyday because i i one to all this won last forever but yknow and he like well when we re ninety yknow you ll know so yeah i know its good one of us feels that no but he has a daughter and that was from high school um his girlfriend yeah i got pregnant and then he stayed with her and they tried to work out and they never got married and that was when you lived in canada so she lives in canada now and he goes yknow he talks to her all the time and then they re real open about that i mean she real good about letting the little girl come and she ll stay the summer us and yknow he ll drive up there and see her uh huh his daughter twelve yeah yeah um seventeen and nineteen yeah yeah yeah and uh she adorable uh she real good yeah yeah everything healthy and great um she and then my daughter i mean i think she just gonna be a real good influence she a single mom and um the father is in another relationship and probably on his way to be getting married and yknow so it doesn look like he gonna be in the picture that much and she had trouble trying to decide whether she wanted him to be too so because you right he doesn seem he doesn seem to have any problem it always been yknow what ever she i know so far it worked out pretty well so yknow i sure in a situation like that things are gonna come up but we ll we ll deal with it yeah no she yeah well she stayed um she stayed with us like for the first and then she was done she was like ready to go so and that was okay but her apartment lease was up the uh week that she was in the hospital having the baby so i had to move her and uh my husband family was visiting at the time and so his mom stayed she lives in florida and she stayed with me and helped me pack her whole apartment and get her in to her new apartment and and that was just yknow well i know and yknow when i think back about that week that was just crazy because it was on a saturday morning she went into labor so i was up all night saturday and all day sunday i didn get home till sunday night and then hi oh his his brother from vancouver his daughter from canada and his mom from florida were staying with us and they were leaving that tuesday so yeah it was like yeah uh was five weeks early delivering so it was really yknow unplanned as far as when we were expecting it yeah you were past ready yeah yeah oh gosh oh well when you think about the different generations and things we certainly didn have the things to worry about that people do who knows in elementary and junior high and we would have never dreamed of anybody having good or even in let alone a knife i mean that and that violence and that that goes back to kids and how much time and and effort you put in to them yknow kids are ignored and pushed aside and they re in the way and there so many people that don even want them and yknow and then they get in to school and they get violent and they they take it out yknow and everybody surprised yknow i not because i know there a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids and um and going to school is getting to be so dangerous i think because you have so many of them in one little room and they re coming from so many different backgrounds and if you take each one of their situations i can bet the statistics as time goes on that they di they re not gonna have one caring parent yknow maybe not even one of the parents yknow they might have a foster family or yknow somebody that wants to pretend like they care yknow there a lot of the people that that are foster families that only want the money yknow and and there th all that so it it really scary and i think i think that it had something has to be done real fast i don know i think it starts from what we teach them and as adults what we allow to be out there the computers i mean oh my gosh i didn even get a computer because i was so afraid of what they could be able to access there was not yknow there was nothing barred at all when they first came out yeah and yknow where are all those software people they re not responsible for two they re not responsible for yknow all this internet access to all the stuff so it really hard well when you have formulas to make bombs and yknow how to uh step by step of how to commit suicide and yeah they have to be responsible i think because yknow you put an idea in to somebody head and then when you give them the resources to carry those things out i think it it has to be for a lot of it yeah yeah but it and it it parents that fight for the and the what in your community yknow the parents for each individual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be all parents to all these kids as a group yknow it not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they don even know where they are yknow it the kids responsibility to get and go to school yknow maybe the mom and dad didn even come home the night before but yknow i mean there all different kinds of situations so i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being um shown and and have access to yeah yeah you really do yeah um oh i was very naive on that i mean i mean you see it on the news and you but the actual relationships all uh but again do you need to know that unless it pertains to you and then even if it does pertain to you right right i think uh i didn know the difference so it didn affect me at all it just they re just another person um i think more uh as i being exposed to patients with the different lifestyles and knowing how to educate their caregivers and what they need um i felt somewhat uh ill equipped the first few times but um knowing what the expectations are especially like with spinal cord injury patients and when you go into sexuality and teaching them after injury i mean as a nurse you need to be able to educate them i felt pretty inadequate but the uh that was even through nursing school i mean those weren things that were discussed you go to special conferences to get information on that that would be fine but again uh i don it just another person with a different lifestyle it like they re they re they re the same as me it just i think they need to educate me on what important to them and i ll yknow i ll honor and respect as much as i can but even people within different i mean a catholic isn a catholic in my opinion i mean there some old time catholics i mean like my mom i mean that they just are very strict catholics and abide by the old rules before the vatican and i think there a new modern age of catholics so even if you say i jewish or i gay or i african american or whatever i still think they re varying they re still a person with different needs and wants and what their traditions and culture and family values are are still gonna be very different and you need to find out from that individual person what it is that they need no uh oh yes yes well just like premarital sex i mean there was no way i would ever discuss anything like that ever with her i mean that was just something that you didn right you don no no no but okay should be but is it um hum um hum um hum taboo yeah sure sure it took us ten years to have and i think my mom genuinely thought i was doing birth control and we weren but you always knew the subtle undertones undertones you know is she or isn she it was just like well i not gonna discuss it with her because i knew that was a no no to her but i wasn but she didn need to know it was right i mean if i would have chosen to do that well it my choice oh god my husband a lot better at these type of questions cause he was methodist and he chose to turn catholic when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was exposed to his it like boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser then mine and just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and uh being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children that he didn i gonna let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really don care what religion what he is i mean with my husband i really didn care if he turned catholic or not i do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and that he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people i think that important if he wants to be catholic great if he doesn that okay too okay okay anything that was foreign in my bed and not knowing it it would wake me up especially i mean i think you kind of have different level of awareness when you are a mother and you re sleeping in a bed with your infant because um hum um hum pretty well there i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother it it really he he nurtures him too so it neat to watch um hum um hum right and they re in so much competition um hum well actually i ve picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so i i working for a research firm just for the convenience of the hours i i want to get back into the nursing field but right now i just can take that much time away because that would be least an eight hour shift and i don think that we re ready for that he a teacher um hum he works at a high school yeah he teaches ninth and tenth graders no don think that at all i be deceiving myself i think i i guess when i i heard about him i just like oh my gosh i can believe all of the the things that these kids are experiencing i didn know about whatever until i was much much older i didn worry about that when i was that age and it kind of scary i have no um hum um hum um hum yeah i guess my i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they don take time to raise their kids and establish the morals in the home and they re just like oh well they ll learn it there whatever and the kids um they re basic where they learn things is their peers they don get it everything instilled at home that pretty much what yknow i ve seen talking to my husband and yknow and there so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they re ready um hum um hum but yeah um hum yeah the media exposure i blame it on that yeah because yknow there been a lot more kids that have died in school then yknow just recently i guess it wasn in the biggin numbers at one time but there been random violence in schools yknow where kids would die even more than yknow seven or whatever and i think that the media just made it into something that they ve glamorized it and some of the kids i think are screwed up anyway and they re just like well hey yknow i can do that and i ll be on the te yeah i do i think that a big part of that because they want their name known and they don care if they die anyway um hum um hum um hum yeah yeah it been glamorized and they don they don value human life either i don think because there so much violence yknow you can watch tv and not seeing somebody get shot or something and it just like it not really real because it yknow you turn the channel and you see the same actor doing something else and you re like see it wasn real and i don think they i think i don know um hum um hum um hum yeah because they think they re grown they think they re grown and they re like twelve and thirteen and they ve been having sex since they were ten and it just like and you know how and they re having babies earlier and earlier and it just really scary i think it should be the parent responsibility but i have no objection to them teaching it somewhat in the schools i guess um hum i don know that they use the if they had it i i don know um hum um hum i personally agree with that but that just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i don know i i don think that there one solution that ll fit every every child and every situation i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so yknow obviously his he said his dad told him about condoms yknow so they re gonna make that decision on their own i say just and and plus with the internet and everything they they have access to so much information and i think that it falls back on the parents still if you re gonna be a parent you need to be and i don think that it getting done um hum um hum her and her mother went and seen it and everything we were divorced at the time and uh then i went and bought the movie and and brought her over to my house on the weekend and everything and showed her the movie and i said this is we re going to watch she goes all right you know we was eating pizza you know and and put it on and then when he she starts bawling and everything and i going well what the matter and she goes well he going to die i said no he ain you ve seen the movie but you know it wasn to her the way i took it was that you know it wasn the same it it was just wasn the same movie so and in this one he could die so um hum um um hum no there a lot of people go to church that aren worth anything too you know so i don really believe that per going to church you know uh uh makes you a better human being than another human being i believe that the you know your i believe that most people with basic uh structure in their life if it based similar to the bible or you could say buddhism or whatever you know uh uh that you ll tend to have a better than you will if you non quote unquote religious religious ways but i don believe somebody going to church makes them a better human being than the next person uh because there a lot of hypocrites that go to church now these kids i i think more just more than anything else i mean one thing i i remember hearing it a lot about too was they we they were picked on i mean come who wasn picked on you know i mean just because you re i mean i wasn really a an athletic i did play uh sports when i was in in high school but i wa damn sure wasn any good you know like other guys but whether i did or whether i didn you know i i don i don nobody picked on me i mean one time i got into it wha with one of the uh centers in football you know big old guy and then uh and i still about the same size but oh he said he going to kick my you know what and everything i said well be outside you know no he he didn even come ba i mean he came out but it like he went the other way i thought well you know he you take it if he get a big kick out of kicking my skinny little butt you know then but you know and years ago it was kind of funny we seen him uh seen each other and everything and uh and at the someplace around and he sit there and went hey remember that time i said yeah yeah yeah he says i didn he said i didn think you stand up to me i said well you know what the heck you know only thing you could do is beat my rear end you know so i think there a heck of a lot more to it then what we ll probably ever know um you know tho they really haven checked into the background of the parents you know they re still what their beliefs were and everything uh and i think that a shame because you know you mentioned it about something accidentally happingening where uh some kid shoots another kid you know and then the parents are are responsible it and everything you know these two kids went in to kill and they wanted to kill more than what they killed uh then they killed so we ll never know their endpoint why they did it but i think there got to be something that we could out you know uh from their parents as to how they lived you know they could have been anything you know they could have been down there they could have been making him making him do it you know uh uh i just think it a different time now i don think i think everybody living more today and talking about the future you know hoping that the future i think there a quote unquote uh in time aspect to life you know everybody living longer everybody uh there more medical things where people get uh can be healed things that they couldn be healed uh so everybody today is living uh basically as today as their where back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i wasn really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about tomorrow getting married having kids you know and having a nice place to live um hum yeah and then you know then i ll show that son of a gun you know i ll i ll shoot him you know uh like you know the guys that were picking on him i don even know whether they even shot him then but um but yeah i think they kind of just thought you know i i i ll you know i ll i ll to them that you know they can push me around and unfortunanley uh they didn really anything except for that they that death is um hum she graduated last year so uh but she went to she went ho she was on home study so sh um hum um hum no she did uh she my ex wife did uh i would ve her to get continue going to school but she had some problems with some students and stuff um right she just went there last year hum she had a uh she taught a tu by a tutor from she from kirkisville that she graduated which is a suburb of saint louis um um um generally it in the summertime uh that the way it was when she was going to school uh now you know with her going to school at like at like at uh saint louis um i guess it would be that way but we really ever ha havn really haven talked about that but my ex wife got family here so uh you know she comes in about two or three weeks at least out of a summer and i tend to see her then um hum oh yeah i uh i think she really kind of knows that from conversations uh with me and while she was growing uh you know mine uh my values and stuff basically are uh more religious oriented you know uh than i would say my wife but uh uh so i think she kinda she knows what i value as being important what i value as being not important and but on it the rest of the question ih i i love to have been able to have uh uh been ykno yknow every other weekend sounds good you know as far as a um i would say see in mine i don think they really were because i can really say for anybody else uh but but we would we had tende we had intended on having a uh we got divorced in eighty eight and we had intended but then the next couple three years of having joint custody but then our divorce was somewhat bitter or became even more bitter and everything you know um so that tended not to not to happen and then she ended up getting transferred to to saint louis from here so it wath something that rea really wah wouldn wouldn have wouldn have been able to happen when she moved out there and that was in ninety so um hum right legal is better and um yeah and and uh i would never i would i would never wanna go back to the old way never yeah yeah yeah yeah um i think so i think partial birth isn such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever comes up but i with so many things it it like a it a foot in the door if we can do that then we can say well yknow maybe not in the third trimester and then we can say well not in the second trimester and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i um i mean i know so many people who you know when they get pregnant get so are so conscientious about about what they eat and and i mean they won take antihistamines in hay fever season and yknow so many things that they won do and they re so conscientious about it it hard for me i mean i nd i just don know anybody who smoked when they were pregnant or anything like that on the other hand i think i think it a choice and um i mean you you wanna you wanna try to help them you wanna make them aware of health issues but i mean a lot of women are not getting prenatal care either and and that part of it and you can you can arrest them for that you just gotta get them to the doctor yeah yeah yeah yeah i didn i if if a there can there can be sanctions for doing the right thing and um uh so i would be i opposed to that i well yeah i i guess you have to say that i was i be opposed to arresting mothers for anything um in in in that relation that it just that the effort should focus on on getting them to stop but not forcing them to stop whatever it is they re doing beer bottles sure do um hum they re all um in business uh they work uh they re scattered i have a son in sacramento and a son uh in atlanta georgia and then i have a daughter in tulsa oklahoma and i have a daughter in ruston virginia so they did they re all marrie well three are married yeah they re they have a very nice standard of living all of them do i have six um hum um hum i know i know it i know it but yknow there there um three three of the family three of the children have children and they each have two there a bo a gi in each one the girl is the uh uh oldest and then the boy second and uh that good though and i hope and i know my son who isn married right now he um thirty one i know that he wants children very badly so so i should have probably end up with about eight or ten i would ima i would imagine so grandchildren um hum yeah i thought was forty three oh but they were they were all around the same age yknow and going to college my daughter julie does uh is very active though in um not necessarily that she has adopted two her two children so she become very active in the adoption procedure in tulsa and uh oh okay okay uh yeah as far as the siblings go bernie is uh does charitable work dorothy uh has a lot of grandchildren and a lot of children she has six children so i think her family is her within her her life they she she does more with the children because most of them live here yknow our children are all away so we have the time oh i would be surprised interactive they are i think my daughter jennifer is very active uh um not so much um the the type of work that i do but i think she very charitable very giving very um um hum hum um hum um and her family hum um um hum i think i would say the same thing because uh um course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i learned a lot from her selflessness and um yknow i i said to myself because i had post partem depression with my third and fourth child and i thought it what good am my going to be to these children if i not able to take care of them so decision was said after the fourth child we would practice birth control so i and i felt comfortable that no because i think there the ideal in everything and if you can live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do and uh i think that where i was coming from i mean even now um i mean i i could never agree with abortion lets say i i would stand by the church and and most most of the church laws i do stand by but i guess the birth control issue became so personal and um it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with a what i felt was a clear conscience and what i did i don have any regrets for it what about you i think it has a lot to do with the fact that the that they the church yeah pro procreation part of what marriage is all about but i see marriage as more than just propagating so that yknow ba a lot of my decisions were based upon that they haven hum um right right well and don you think too the psych that the more they have found out psychologically speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the um throes of not having enough or or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both know the ek that experience from being one of eleven children raised so yknow you didn have the advantages that um hum um hum um hum right right and of course i think too as in america the um the farm families yknow they wanted that was more laborers for the vineyards so to speak so i think that might have influenced a lot of that but over the years it it um it just made sense to me in fact it looks like in my family that they re going the children are going to be mostly in twos yknow not even going to three or four i mean is it not over yet but my girls are forty two and forty one soon to be forty one so um i think that their child bearing years are over um hum um hum oh i know oh my gosh yeah see there i think there has to be a quality to life too and hum it very hard that was your youth and that good i mean that good to be there and they had they you know they went through their own training and everything we didn interface with each other or nothing like that you know i mean you might see one walking or marching somewhere but as far as fraternizing you weren allowed to um hum um hum um no not really i mean different cultures and everything uh but i i went to school with blacks so i mean that wasn that big a thing except for the influx of the you know i didn realize how many were being drafted or being enlisting into the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the in the country you know but it didn bother me uh religion basically everybody when i was in there back in the sixties the i mean everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity either catholic or something like that but uh nowadays you know you have the uh uh more outspoken isla mus muslims and uh islam and uh judia and judaism and everything so and there again i don have a problem with that you know because you you got to meet yourself you know you got to make your peace with your maker because you know if you believe in religion you re you re here temporarily for an eternity later on you know um hum um hum well i one thing uh you know being uh uh i came from basically a poor neigh poo poor uh uh lifestyle uh early life and everything you know so uh um if anything i guess it kind of made me negative uh towards people that had an influence had money and didn do any thing good with it you know i a firm believer that if you got something that you should share it with other other people i don always practice what i preach but you know that i be a good philosophy to live by uh and people of other religions and everything um you know i learned a lot about religion when i i was raised baptist basically but uh i practice more catholic than anything else now uh but i generally pretty knowledgeable about judaism and muslims and everything just because i find it interesting um you know was in sixty nines when i went in so you know you can kind of figure that it was the okay it was kind of uh it was different when i because see because when i went in uh and you know well i never had any problem with a black person or or i didn really care you know as long as they uh did their job and everything i basically the same way today uh but people coming from other cities like chicago new york yknow and places like that where they were treated poorly by whites you know they um they tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you weren like that you know uh we only had one racial incident when i was in the service uh where it was we were predominantly white uh platoon and the because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so uh and then the security cops were pa above us and they were predominantly black you know and i don know what happened something happened one time there was only like twenty people in our whole uh platoon it was all in the same barracks and uh some guy said something off color to one of them or something like that you know and got kind of out of hand for a while but you know thank god nothing really happened um hum i think that the i think society is today of today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where getting by with stuff you know and they re more vocal about it as opposed to being violent about it back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there were people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh know there are bad blacks and there bad whites too you know so but not all of them are you know are that way um hum but that what i mean it more you know it they re they re more vocal about it more uh uh more okay okay um i grew up in canton which is near cleveland um i moved here in ninety two to go to college um i spent my senior year abroad in england then i came back i have a double major and i had a quarter to finish off then i came back and did that and then went back to england to work then came back and back to england again and came back and i freelance right now freelance writer and editor um all types i i used to work in the music industry so i do a lot of music related writing in the position i in right now i do it just a variety of travel writing and that kind of thing concentrate primarily on editing uh actually when i was at ohio state i worked for the newspaper and i did a lot of music interviewing and writing there and then i moved up to editor and it was sort of through that job that i got my first job with sony while i was as a ha as a sort of ohio representative so i was concentrated in ohio state and then yknow basically it just something i not doing this as a career it just sort of something i doing in the meantime till i decide whether i going back to school or what i doing um a lot of online magazines music magazines that kind of thing uh i would either go back in uh languages or actually i a psychology undergrad yeah i lived i studied in bristol and then when i went back and worked and then lived again i lived in london it was fantastic right absolutely i i can imagine that it would i mean i sure brazil would ve been more different experience but i think it was more just a resentment for sort of everything about america and what what they re fed it was a real love hate relationship yknow it was while they totally embrace the culture and all the stores and everything like that and the food it yknow the fast food or whatever they hate it at the same time because it ruining yknow an i had a lot of friends from elsewhere in yknow western europe and uh yeah they just were kin kind and i i was quite surprised actually because when i first went there uh i worked on an previous i mean mackinaw island do you know it sort of just north of michigan but and i had met some english people there and it was yknow there all the americans were like oh english people your accent is so neat and all that kind of thing and then when i went there yknow i and this was actually one of my friends but i remember yknow she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then she sort of looked at me and she said like oh actually i shouldn be asking you i don wanna learn the american way to say those like i wanna learn the british way to and people would say things all the time and it was yknow they ask you what your background was and if you say well i american they said well yknow like where your ancestors from or whatever and then you would tell them and then yknow on the same turn they would just sort of like snicker and be like oh you re not whatever of this european thing you re yknow sort of yeah yeah like definitely and and that what they say that we ve done to the language and everything else and and you re not a typical american but and then the next hour and a half they just say how bad americans are and you kind of think like well thanks for the exclusion but you still have been insulting me for an hour and a exactly right or american literature yknow yknow if yknow a historic building they re like oh there no history in america uh huh right right well it obviously i sort of surmounted that because i ve been yknow i spent a lot of time there since then i think had i only studied there for a semester a quarter i would ve come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then yknow after that yknow you just sort of yeah get to the point where you re just kinda yknow laugh it off and just think oh here we go again and then that it yknow uh no the lifestyle was yknow very easy to fit into and i ve always been yknow interested it and yknow sort of like to the whole like european culture um before i went there but i think the most difficult was actually because i was studying english when i went there and yknow studying here is a dime a dozen and studying english in amer or in england yknow sort of i don know uh more uh sort of elitist which i didn realize before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american and the classes were really small and it was yknow you i definitely got a feeling and a it there were a few classes that really stood out where tha yknow there was sort of yknow you i hafta say something or i hafta give a presentation or something and it was sort of like oh yknow what what does this american know and yknow it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my um peers in classes i mean not directly they never say anything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of yknow that feeling of uh and what they would say about americans and american culture like at that discussion group yknow in front of you yknow so i love columbus actually um when i left i was fed up with columbus and but like anything yknow after being away for a while and not really yknow being i mean i have friends there and everything but yknow i missed my friends and i missed really sort of yknow knowing everything in the city because london is never gonna be like that for me yknow and it just a totally different experience and yknow i did miss columbus and i kinda glad to be back although now i miss london um well maybe not columbus in particular but i don know i was i think i was just a little burnt out because i was doing the two majors and i was i had a heavy course load every quarter and i had gone to summer school here as well just to get more done and so i yknow done seven straight quarters and i sure that added to it i had a lot of hard classes and yknow i was just tired of ohio state and tired of being here and red tape and that whole thing in english um hum uh well i think because i went abroad i had basically one extra quarter beyond four years but i said i went to summer school too and i was taking like yknow twenty one to twenty three a quarter so yes um hum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i ve yknow i had a lot of opportunity to be there and to do those things so and i mean there there are yknow it obviously you can compare it but yknow there are cultural things to do in columbus and it does sort of make me mad when yknow people are kinda like oh columbus yknow there nothing to do there i find myself defending columbus a lot more now than i ever would ve before uh huh uh the two parter uh last season where it was the advertises full disclosure and what and the first episode the first half was excellent had the cigarette smoking man just it was from his perspective he was talking that then the second half got like oh no and it turns out it was the the uh the faceless aliens set a trap for the for the guys and i didn like the way it was resolved but i like the fact that it wasn resolved the way that they set it up so i think that i mean we supposedly know about samantha but she out there somewhere yknow we don have again we don have clear evidence where she is and there were couple times where they where we thought we knew where samantha was uh and when there were all those clones of her uh i think that was in the second season or so um i think if th if they were gonna end it they were gonna have to have like three episodes in a row that just were tieing up all these loose ends that they keep having i suspect they probably won do that they ll um leave things open ended for future tv movies or maybe another uh feature length movie uh yeah and they re also talking about cause uh uh the actors the the reason they re ending it is because the actors don wanna do it there was talk i don know if there still pursuing this that they have new characters take over the roles and i mean the character development is the most important part i think um so i think that ll be a failure but that also sorta tells me that they re gonna leave things kinda open right i they they could ve taken i mean well they killed all these people off but i they could ve you ll put them into the background you have them do a couple of shows a season and then had yknow i don know the adventures of uh oh agent spender and the hell what what her name but then they they killed off all those like supporting former files associated people so they they couldn go in that direction they have to just bring in new people which uh i think it probably wouldn be a good idea yeah and i i used to kinda worry about the effect that tv had on me um i when i was little i used to watch a lot of tv i come home from school and plop myself in front of the tv and watch i like yknow four cartoons back to back or so everyday after school or i that kind of thing and then saturday mornings it would be uh a block of yknow from six in the morning until afternoon or something these days i don watch nearly that much tv um i don buy these arguments that people make that say that like children are like like violence in tv is affecting children i mean i i ve seen some evidence of of exercises where in schools the kids will watch uh like a a violent cartoon like i don know like roadrunner or something and then be a little rougher but i don i don that it it goes into like values i don associate like rising crime or something with uh like crime on tv or something i i mean it if there is a correlation i mean i i more of the yknow like parents have a greater influence on the children then tv ever could i mean i laugh watched a lot tv but i feel that my parents taught me was right and wrong and i watched a lot of rather violent tv violent movies all that kinda thing and uh um i have become visually desensitized to like the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that and real violence um i mean in studying history i exposed to a number of like rather gruesome events in history that still i still find disturbing um also hang out in low life bars and every once in a while there ll be a fight and it it still it i mean it i it still is disturbing to me i i i have a distinct difference in my head between reality and fiction and maybe kids like aren making that distinction but i don think so and i think if if someone isn making that distinction it i don know that that they re not well i don i don know i don have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have it i feel that i have a distinct uh uh uh very clear distinction between what is uh fact and what is fiction what is true and what is imaginary and uh so for me i don think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that tele television has affected me is i am full of media references when i speak yknow when i hanging out with friends someone mentions a a subject i like hey simpsons made fun of that yknow at some point ah uh that the effect that it sees on me i don think that too big an effect people always used to yknow like quote shakespeare or something i guess that ten times more elevated so like oh references that shakespeare line or something but i mean it it a part of our culture and i a part of it but i don see it as negatively effecting me i still get all the stuff done i need to get done um well i found that that i mean everyone has people from outside the united states have stereotypes about the united states and when they actually get to know someone those stereotypes dissipate um i mean i actually had a conversation very similar to this the other night with a couple of germans that i met at a coffee house um i mean the the stereotype that most americans have of germans are those of bavarians uh and not real bavarians but stereotypical bavarians uh beer drinking bratwurst eating sauerkraut eating lederhosen wearing uh yknow blond haired blue eyed overweight people yeah yeah well i asked these germans what the stere what stereotypes they like are prevalent in germany uh of americans and they said yknow americans are cowboys and eat at mcdonald three meals a day um hum um right right right it awful probably i mean i just even notice like road rage just in general like with myself when i was working full time even with my child at home just the frustration of getting home i was so stressed with work and now being part time i so much more relaxed i mean the pressures that these kids these days have on them and you re right without families at home to give them the guidance i mean at columbine if i not mistaken that was the one who had the journal who had somebody had made bombs in the garage and the family didn know about it and i was like how can a family not know that but if they re so busy and working and trying to provide right wow um i don know if there could be there are certain programs different community based programs getting but again those are my values as i say steering the kids into a church based program if they can be there putting them with um families and friends that you know and trust to to look after them giving them the guidance need the ymca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where they re supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families don have and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs i mean that goes along with my and beliefs i mean were going to send our child i already know to parochial schools there no way i going to send him to a public school and even my my husband a um boy scout um leader and just listening to the boys there iy he he did a program last night on respect just don talk when other people are talking just general that i you should take for granted that they just don have those they re just not getting it right um hum i want the discipline and i want the religion basis i want i don want somebody i i want them to be able to feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can from our friends that have gone yeah the with uh their discipline is expelling the child from school while they re expelling them to a home where the parents working where they re just getting three days of free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble they really aren learning from that right i do i went to public um through sixth and actually i was quite pleased with the program but my mom also had me in um i don know it ccd class it a cath it uh monday nights you go and you get the um basis of the of the church and that was important to me and then um i went to um parochial school for seventh and eighth grade which was in my opinion horrendous but excuse me i think it the age of the children in general yknow the whole puberty thing and going into a new school where these kids had been together since kindergarten and trying to fit in at that age and then i went to parochial sk i went to um for highschool and that was a very good experience uh new the boyfriend the different things they were trying behind the building yknow it just the boy girl i mean just not no very much so um hum i do think there some and i don think they probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i don think they probably be exposed to you know the gay lesbian uh i think that would probably just be blown over and didn go very much in depth you know about sex and your sex ed classes were pretty but on the other hand for me that was fine i don know our friends it have eleven year old that going to public school i mean he had a class already where he had to carry around this baby he went we went to a hockey game with him and here he is with this baby at this hockey game and it was just like at eleven that awfully young but again he got this baby yet they didn talk about how this baby how you make a baby or everything assoc and i don know if they should be talking about that yet but here he is with this baby and it just like okay they do offer sex ed but it you know very um scientific in nature and then we did have a um think it was actually in religion class where they paired you up you were a couple and you had to go through budgets and chores and it was more that type of task right right mm yeah right i don know that so controversial i mean i mean to the point i mean they show them how to put condoms on bananas in public schools and it like well are you promoting sex then or shou do i pr uh you could argue both of those too but i me personally i say that just teaching them more than what they need to i think that a little bit too much but then again i feel like sometimes i so naive i mean a lot of that wasn introduced yknow i was just like well should i have known that i don think it hurt me not knowing it you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really don know how to how how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like uh we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have ah a day where everyone like the whole class as class could go have a picnic like in the practice football field and that was cool because everyone got along those days you didn have to go to class you know you spent the second half the day hanging out and so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know but then that hurts the the a the administrators in a sense that they re there to provide an edic education so it be rough in like my high school they they put up and they had they locked at certain times you couldn go in them and like it was getting and they had like we were on the front page the akron beacon journal because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought this the dogs they found i was surprised they found a lot of drugs and i wasn real i was more surprised that they found a lot of alcohol like i wouldn like you know like some people if they do drugs at school and stuff i not saying that right but they ll they ll do it but like alcohol it be so hard to like hide because it you know and you hold it out but they found like bottles of and stuff like that and i think they even might have found like one or two so and that to me was but my high school is two thousand people so i guess by sheer numbers one or two persons would bring a gun um it considered urban but because it north of akron we play a lot of like the inner city like in akron schools but in my opinion it suburbia like but we have the we have the big city problems like there a lot drugs and i i think that just because the building old so no one really takes pride it and then it two people so that like the just the sheer numbers of it i think i thi i like if you had to ask i say i was a straight mid western suburbanite but there are people that i go to school with and ashland is twenty five thousand like in the city and they they say that a city and my school or where i grew up was more than double that just over double that it was like sixty thousand and cuyahoga falls and to me that considered suburbia so and to me ashland is considered the sticks i mean there peop there amish buggies that go by but like to some people that considered a city so i think it you re perspective in sense for fun we ve been playing a lot of pool a lot pool actually uh we go to a bar called the out inn because it cheap and it fun there uh out inn is over i don even know i know how to get to it like the way we walk but i don know what street its on yeah it real wa it like the one of the closest bars and we go there because they have a huge patio and so you can just sit out and talk and and then uh we play a lot of board games lately too like we just bought axis and allies me and my roommates so it really weird because uh it it kind of a fun game it just strange because uh like we re on se i came down in semesters so there was still a month where everyone was down here and now there like nobody down here so it myself my two roommates and maybe a handful of like other people that we know so it like the social aspects like is has diminished a lot but that still i mean for fun we uh play a lot of video games do like i guess you think thike the natural like things you would expect from a college guy go out try and hit on girls that doesn work that type of yeah just get out there and have fun and then like we lift uh probably like four days a week i know i don look like it but but i go with them and have a time so yeah yeah it uh right around here like it like down the hill kind of by the horsesh yeah yeah so that where we go and i don have a student i so i just sneak in but it the summer they don even care they never i look like a college student that would go here so i ve never had a problem so we go and that and like we re planning a road trip we re we we re not we haven decided we re thinking atlantic city or uh florida or new york city new orleans those the choices we re trying to narrow it down i know those yeah you know when else ih ih at this point in my life when else would i be able to do so uh maybe maybe i like i said like it really weird em most people make fun of me for still wearing detroit hats and being a detroit fan because i ve lived in ohio for so long but when you re little is when yih i think you learn loyalty like i love the old detroit tigers from the eighties and like that when i learned to like baseball like i collected baseball cards i lived in detroit and so that why it like stuck with me so like i uh i remember when i had my tonsils out in third grade like you re allowed to bring one item because like you re a little kid to like make you feel better and i brought my detroit tigers hat so and i i owul like i ll only wear detroit or boston and boston just because i uh was born there but and like people make fun of me they re like you know because detroit horrible they re in last place they re like why don you pitch you know be happy for the indians i like i for them that fine but oh yeah yeah oh you get your choice kind well that yeah yeah equal distance they re definitely i thought they be a lot they got they picked up ken griffey and then on top of it they we ha they were good without him and now they picked him up and they seem to be doi they still struggling i like i don understand that yeah but the indians are horrible right now i like i watched a game yesterday and they were i think they were few days ago seven and a half games back from the chicago whitesox we watched the game yesterday and i don know if we have a lot of injuries or anything i don really follow the indians but the a like i couldn even recognize like that many of the names like to me that was very strange yeah that that pretty much out there yeah they definitely have the sticks definitely yeah they the the big sticks are definitely those two teams it seems that way i don know why that is you know in the eighties they had a lot of games were like one to two you know shut outs stuff like that now i mean he my roommate was telling me the yankees beat someone twenty one to something the other day and that ridiculous that to me i know yeah i know it ridiculous i just i find that just yeah it dilutes there there only so much talent so it dilutes it and that that makes sense and a lot of the new ballparks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather than watch like uh a two to one ball game because that more boring yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly last three outs everyone like yeah let hope he does it but until then you re like okay this is ridiculous yeah all right no no i think i all no not at and uh so i got some of the inside dope on uh the area from him but uh they had there a i don know whether it been a large grainery or something that had a concrete floor and some industrious i had chipped a hole about so big around in that and dug out the dirt under it so that he got down in a an area under that concrete floor the concrete was about so deep which better than that much dirt and so uh whenever they we heard any firing like it was coming toward us why we head for that hole oh let see i ve already told you more than i ever told anybody else i think oh at an at anzio you said oh uh huh yeah yeah yeah one of my kids got it for me it i don know makes our sound like and well i don think he exaggerated but he uh he was selective about the people that he he described in there which was purpose of his book i suppose uh and of course bill mauldin was the greatest i you go got have you seen his cartoons and uh haven you well he his two main car uh main characters in his cartoons were willie and joe two i and uh oh they saw the the ragged end of the war according to that and so uh i can think what some of their observations were but there usually just one or two lines of of dialogue under one of their their cartoons and the cartoon told most of it there was one where they were going along and there a little uh scroungey looking dog about so long and about that high kind of following along after them joe i glad that i finally see somebody i can be sorry for that worse ara worse off than i what under the conditions that had to prevail i was treated well enough it was uh part of the time i don feel like i ve gained anything from it that i didn deserve i mean in the way of benefits huh well that and see uh they had the i bill of rights which was a boon to thousands and thousands of guys my age and when i started as an apprentice in the shop they said well we ll start you at a dollar an hour well i thought that sounds pretty good yknow in nineteen forty five in the fall of nineteen forty five so then as things worked out in washington they came out with the i bill of rights we found out that uh that would apply to apprentices too and so uh soon as my shop found out that i could draw that whole ninety dollars a month i mean whoo they said well since you re getting that why we ll cut cut your pay back to what you would normally draw under the apprenticeship program which was fifty seven cents an hour and for a to support a wife and a wall small small baby on that was kind of tough going well uh i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up with as i was but there were a lot of them that were i mean uh like uh what his name that who wrote the book you just yeah uh i was i think that he he right that our my generation was uh oh i want to don want to say spiritual but more morally uh well directed than at least a lot of the pe people kids today i don say that of all of the because i know that some of them were brought up right but uh well i was uh i i was pretty well established about responsibility and that sort of thing before i went into service i was the oldest son in a family of ten so uh i had some family responsibilities we were my brother and i and my sisters were active in the four clubs which was a a going thing at that in the uh thirties and uh and did i say we went to church fairly regularly but to tell you the truth i can remember too much that i taught then but i was exposed to it anyway and i i sure that some of it rubbed off on me well uh my youngest son married a catholic girl who was from a large catholic family and their kids are going to a catholic school now i think that those four kids at least among my grandchildren are getting pretty much at the same training that i did or maybe better than i got uh my oldest son two daughters well they re good kids and they re smart kids but i don think that they have the moral grounding that uh greg and beth kids do you said this is all confidential and my but now my daughter my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and uh i think that they are they one of them particularly is i think in good moral good sort of guy and the other one i don feel like i know as well but i i really think that they re both good and uh see uh i can um hum i don really work with them all i basically do is i know a lot of people and everything and they tend to come in there for help and you know and i just kinda help out with the uh some of the work that be done talk to them or whatever you know uh i tell they can go there it the a vietnam veteran association some people don even know about it you know a lot of them they don want any better they won want anything different that all they want i think that basically that in a nut shell they ve reached a point in their life where you know that they re cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death or um smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh crack or whatever and uh then just living in a hell i mean basically because you know the open shelter i don know whether you ever been around there but it it isn a pretty sight you know i say of uh i think they the the a in generally sees on the average five seven ten something like that a day and not all of them homeless and not all of them are are vietnam vets either you know uh but you know they tend to say i say of those there about three three to four of them that are vietnam veterans uh a day and they tend to come back i mean i originally started going in there just drinking coffee you know to kill time and everything you know and uh now i kinda know everybody you know and somebody ll walk in and i ll say hey how it going you know and they ll talk th then there i there another thing to a a about a lot of the uh people back uh vietnam ever and everything that the they ll tend to talk to maybe you or talk to somebody else and uh a like an authoritative figure and not believe a damn word they say right right um hum well they go to the clinic sometimes and uh clinic basically a pill popping place you know here take these you ll feel better you know then they they really don get any satisfaction for what ails them you know that side of a you know you tell you you tell them you can drink but yet you give them a pill that ll give them the same effect you know whose um hum um hum um hum um hum um hum um pick up bodies um hum um hum um hum um hum um hum well i know people that ll sleep outside and uh not all of them are veterans and everything but they there again they don want to be a part of the quote unquote sheltered system you know uh staying at an open shelter a or something like that i think it just if they re vietnam vets i think it the authority thing you know well you lied to me once you lied to me four hundred times since then you know you probably going to lie to me again you know and uh then a lot of them i don think are capable while in their present condition i know like the friend of mine i talking about there no way in hell that he could hold down a job right now but i knew him when he was eight ten months sober and he worked every day but just something happened why he got him and his girlfriend broke up and that was like around christmas time and i ran into him like february or something like that and ever since february its he been sitting on a bench getting drunk everyday and i sit there and go you know i tell people the a clinic and everything and they got a homeless thing uh over there i say you know this guy friend i know you know he a vietnam vet you guys need to get out there and help him you know i mean you re in more of a uh situation than i am to be able to go out and and and sit there and but he wants me to take him like mary haven or something like that and he been there before and all he does is stay till he sobers up and goes back out um hum um hum pot never been uh never been associated with any kind of a crime that were some a violent crime of any um hum um hum turn the turn the music up and it already blasting you know uh um hum okay saw a lot of stuff like that and met a lot of yeah i met a lot of different people in there lot of interesting people um i helped them set up different things helped them yknow clean them up afterwards prep patients all kinds of different things there was a lot of blood and stuff but i don know when you when it not you it seems a little easier to observe i when you see somebody you know it a little more concerning to you i don know but you see a lot of different stuff and you hope that the majority of it helping this person out now my wife yknow she works she worked in intensive care open heart surgery different patients like that that a lot different than where she is now with the cancer because there so many different factors there you re you know wih she says it so hard to see somebody thirty years old and they come in and they have uh breast cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things she says yknow two or three times a week yknow your your heart just drops out because you see that they have their little kids and now you re gonna be going for chemotherapy radiation all this stuff yknow it unbelievable how many it just hard to believe how many people go through there they re talking fifty sixty patients a day where she works and this is just breast cancer place so it ju i just i can believe there that many people that need the service all the time there like five or six different doctors and so she learned a lot more now than cancer because she never been in oncology at all so it was always just trauma patients or open heart bypass patients things like that so it been a whole new learning experience for her too oh no she has to do yeah it chaos up there it is chaos it i mean they had somebody come in to oversee the whole setup to yknow where they needed more help at whether they needed more nurses or the and the guy told her the person that was in charge the head nurse or whatever there no way that person can do that job yknow they still do it yknow so when you re in charge it just a nightmare you re supposed to know where every single patient is where their chart is what going on what room they re in where yknow you re just walking around like you re a crazy person all day then it come home it come home to that and it so different it i don know it just the motherly thing the just yknow they draw to their mothers it just the way it is i guess but it like yknow she says if the mother in the house the mother on duty because yknow they they bypass me straight mom mom mom yknow yeah yeah she just like yeah the minute we walk in the door it like you guys clock out yeah oh yeah the five year old just after her the whole time the minute she walks in the door yknow go go go so it tough oh they i do i try to be as much as possible too i think it it very important that both parents they see both i do most my friends most people i associate with in this and that are a lot more involved in their with their kids than say our parents were as kids yknow oh no no i don feel that at all they yknow we don hesitate our to get together with other friends and take our kids places i don remember my dad doing that stuff yknow two or three dads get together and take six kids to the park or something yknow i don remember things like that yknow he could ve been there maybe but yknow we take them to wyandot lake or yknow the zoo or all types of things oh yeah we got a the best thing you gotta get a membership to everything that what we figured out we got cosi we got the zoo and we got wyandot lake and that way you can go whenever you want if an hour into the show they re not participating properly you can leave and you didn you re not out yknow yeah yknow that cosi great we really like that they really oh oh yeah we re members of there oh yeah we ve probably been five six times already and it huge you can see it in a day you can especially with kids it just too overwhelming yeah at cosi yeah yeah yeah yep yep there a big water area it something to do with the little mermaid or whatever but they really enjoy all that we try to do as much as we can with them outdoor type of thing we do a lot of we do a lot of vacationing we try to go two times a year at least uh her parents live in cape cod so they we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have family in hawaii we have family in virginia beach so everybody co everybody coastal but us and my sister lives in the middle of nobody visits nobody wants to to nebraska yeah what out there come watch the corn grow so yeah she does she comes back a lot they yeah they really like it they have a huge house in the middle of nowhere out on a and my brother in law bought uh his father wendy businesses out and so they own like six wendy out there so but it out in the middle of nowhere that was the whole problem we tried to get him to move and tried to get him to do this years and years ago and nobody wanted to move to nebraska he was doing them from ohio which is really duh running five wendy in nebraska and commuting so he was either driving or flying a lot no i think think they fly to omaha so it not too bad that pretty easy to get into they re about two hours west of omaha so it different for them they re liking it yknow small living out in the country raising the kids yknow their big house huge yard dog yknow i we keep looking and saying yknow now how this different or better for the kids so they re uh five hours from so they still bad lands aren too far and i guess it like nine hundred miles from here so they can still drive back so they come at least once twice a year back to ohio okay no big deal in a heartbeat try and help them but they don i don think they make an effort to like put out any yknow okay um hum art drawing and painting is my major and i i um i like doing all sorts of different things they don i haven even had any painting classes yet so it kind of funny i like taking sculpture and and drawing and next quarter i have a painting class yeah right um hum i ve been into art in in high school i went to uh art like uh and i was for fine arts and i always wanted to do art because i can do anything el no it mostly i i not good at or i mean i could probably major in english or something like that but not math it is the talent my husband good at math so that where i i grateful for um hum i did well i never really think i had first of all i didn have the motivation i don think to put in the effort to do it but i don think i had very good advisors when i was first here i didn really understand the idea of that was separate from art college and that you had to apply and i didn really know i just like oh okay i just well but i didn understand as much as you i just like like clueless as to what i needed to do to become an art major and i go to my advisor and they tell me what to take and it was the art advisor but i didn really think i had to do anything special like i didn kn know about the portfolio review and all that stuff and that was probably my own fault for not asking questions but so it took me a while and and i just kind of went to columbus state and went on a mission then came back and so i just got accepted into that college but it the art school year yeah it it a um probably about four years left i almost done with all my and everything like that so that about done um hum it all i ve learned a lot it been interesting i ve liked my classes well ah i have um i ve a have a different op options i thinking i could either an art teacher or have some kind of um freelance type thing to from my and i i really want to just um hurry up school get done with school as fast as i can i we really my husband and i really wanna have kids and so we don we don wanna wait very much longer the some of the classes i taking are um kind of dangerous though like the fumes from the paints and stuff so i can have to wait till those are over oh yeah stop yeah those are real chemicals yeah you still have to be careful and yeah so you have how many kids us just one well that good that oh that great oh yeah i can wait well actually he was i don know if you ve heard about the deal well he was one the teachers that um tried to start a union and was okay well he he yeah he taught math but they had a general curriculum was just like he taught seventh grade he gave him math science um supposedly social studies all the stuff that i mean it was just it was very poorly run to begin with so we would go out and try and find books for the kids i don know if you heard that they he hadn bought them books and so we had to buy them i mean they got reimbursed but it was just ridiculous so they were trying to do anything they could and just to keep their jobs and keep the school hum um um hum yeah it supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not gotten somewhere um hum right education definitely and it military so yeah uh he hi he and three other people well a lot of them had signed the union they have to have almost everybody sign for it but um he was one of the people that had really been yes and so he fired him but not for that because you can do that it illegal so he but he sent a form letter with everybody ever it was exactly the same to the three people that were fired except for their names were changed for the these like basically made up reasons i mean he uh he kind of in big trouble they they re wanting to pull the charter on him and everything so that i it but he gonna try and um keep the school open which is gonna be ridiculous um hum is his yeah but it just it got out of i guess so i hope that they can keep the school somehow for the kids and but it won be him running it well he working part time at lazarus but really he doesn have so i working yeah he wants to teach he he likes football and he wants to coach football but you have to teach to do that so um hum he was he did some assistant coach at uh for he really liked that uh huh except for last year no i just kidding i i like to watch football i like i ve never really gotten into anything else but now he like he likes the um denver and so i ll watch that with him but i don really know much about it yeah that was pretty i think they i don know what happened oh really oh you re kidding i do have some relatives that are um step my stepmom relatives that are there they re actually members of the mormon church so that i guess i do have some by marriage but they live near bloomington um hum yeah i guess they do i don know what where where it is or how many they have oh you do know oh you probably know more than i do then i never went there with them because uh um my dad very against it um hum he episcopalian so did you really you went maybe even to their ward that funny they re they re the not that you would know you want my name now okay uh hum and you re not being recorded now oh you are i don see a microphone in front of you that what i was wondering okay okay all right alright very good we re up here

international here this last year and so i ready to go cruising okay i have two two um students my one she twenty six two two children one a student here currently and uh the other one is um a uh working cuff at the steubenville ohio uh cuff is uh catholics united for the faith it um she had to go up and graduate from miami university of ohio and got affiliated with uh campus crusade for christ and so forth and went out to dekalb in working for northern illinois then went back working for the inner city area of chicago and found herself that she liked steubenville better and when i relocated her people would say you re crazy young lady you re twenty five and you re moving to steubenville they re migrating out of here but uh she likes the spirituality of the community over there and i think this past year they had two murders over there and it was publicized in the columbus area but uh it should this yes and they had the strong uh public uh support over there it a really is tight knit community it uh quite different columbus needs to learn a lot from that area and uh it a matter of just uh putting in i guess your hands in the your practicing your faith which we well i th ih i i think we tru we oh yeah we re we re church goers but just be going church goers isn uh isn being faithful i think it just a sharing yourself uh with one another in daily lives uh listening to someone outreaching to someone whatever it might be that the the ministry that uh i think our our our lord has given us the opportunity to serve one another and uh that the downfall of our society because we re thinking more of ourself others and i think as as we become older you start thinking about how um much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith it not the materialistic things that the university here progr uh professes to be the thing cuff yes i am and they are the my wife wasn um hum he in his sophomore year i have no idea yknow no it it in uh it in the ag college but uh why it there i don know it a matter of how they fit it in there but it dealing with construction management north oh projects were right from infancy were i was designing the project first of all we had to find out what we had with the vesture and uh as everyone should know even as a residential user you have to know what you have in your house the telephone company doesn provide the service to you anymore well we had to know what we had through out the state of ohio and some eighty eight counties and uh wherever else number of facilities we had and so we went on a scavenger hunt basically because the plans which the utilities had for our locations they could not provide to us because of the uh the vesture ruling so we had to go out and um do our own surveys become self educated through uh courses uh through a and through purdue university it was i think had some courses and um ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group but uh the projects basically we were going from a um putting together a network itself and uh we had a you think of a party line system what they used call daisy chain in the industry uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get on to a data network and we got down to point where we went to a spoke network where everyone had dedicated pipe to the hub um which course eliminated down time but with um that we were not in a position to monitor traffic and telecommunications is very much like a highway you need to know what your load going to be before you construct it or vice yknow otherwise your planning way off well nowadays we re in a position where we re doing more advancement than anything our agency is the only one in the state of ohio and the private network uh as a private sector is still looking as lo looking at us as a showcase we re doing voice over i internet internet protocol which means we re doing voice and data over the same pipe and the long line carriers they don even know how to bill us and i think there an article this last wednesday in the dispatch in business section as to how the can regulate it and because of it they want to deregulate telecommunications uh and so for the past months we haven been getting telephone bills for usage we have the backbone we re paying for and what going to happen out of this whole thing is it offers us a a a a lot of latitude where with uh we can ah now um if we have a contractor lets say over in dayton and we re calling from zanesville office i rather make them long distance we can go on our pipe and if we have a line going over dayton we can make that call as if it a local call avoiding all long distance okay so our backbone still there but ultimately as we get traffic uh measurements we will be able to downsize the number of pipes we have so streamlining our network and uh i said our our engineers they re not engineers per se but they are techies that are really in to this they they enjoy their work and it for it in the forefront of ohio government along with the technology there has to also be the paperwork now i know realize we have a paperless environment quote unquote but we still need to have property manager records that very essential and a lot times when you re talking to engineers they don realize that part of it um they don like the detail at least that aspect of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of uh activity on that whether it been uh installed removed relocated whatever might be but we need know that how it had an impact upon the design of a the particular uh facility voice and data if you are determined as having too much stress by your doctor then the government will pay for a vacation for you just they re that into being sure you re relaxed enough you know and nobody does the sixty hour work weeks like some people apparently are accustomed to around here i mean forty is like the limit yeah they do um i think it something like sixty percent um we pay like forty fifty here oh yeah well there like and you take federal and state and all that and add it up yeah they have uh well okay they do have sales tax but it added in to the price before so you re not just sitting there trying to figure out what it is i wish they could yeah oh my uh i in this uh venturing crew which is through boy scouts our leader has this like society totally planned out he got this thing like thirty percent sales tax and no other tax at all and then it all gets i don know it all works itself out he he every other day you start him on taxes and he ll just start fuming it um he uh business man he really doesn like it like how things work yeah it called uh venturing crew it kind of this off off shoot of uh boy scouts and it for ages teen twenty one uh co ed so we focus on computers but we do camping and yknow he teaches us a lot of uh business uh business ethic and um professionalism as well yes yeah it like um i don know they used to have something called exploring posts that were directly related and then um venturing kind of took over for that like in still in boy scouts and then exploring went off on it own and as a result they took religion out of the program and they put they like homosexuality with the leaders and all that so it i don know we call it like hippy boy scouts um one of my best friends from high school and my boyfriend are both in it and they bugged me about it for ever to come and like i don know about computers so they took me finally like december something and and i have an office within the posi within the um program now and yeah and it just incredible how much i ve learned i think i learn more in that program than i do in all my classes put together yes and no i mean we have high schoolers in there um there no requirements for what school you go to um but we get our internet service partially through ohio state and the vast majority of college students go here um what happened was we know see one of the people on our committee teaches in the math department here so he the math server has tons of extra room on it so he just kind of snuck in our account i it is legal but i not sure how related to university is i don think we take up huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through oar net as well which is i think it just up lane avenue uh they give us the domain name and all that yeah i oh gosh seems like incredible i mean i i used to not understand what the right click on windows was that was like when i moved in and now all of a sudden like i can i installed my own player in my computer like tore the case off and did it it actually not that difficult but yeah it it um i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and there it is yknow um let see what was my decoder card was a little more difficult i had somebody else do it for me um i have a decoder card it what it does is it make it decodes the right away rather than sending it through the processor so it it a lot faster it doesn depend on my processor time like it the movie doesn skip or anything it it just goes straight through um let see no no nothing like that uh twice a month we have our technical modules which are we hook up the tiny little yknow green screen computers and the little old keyboards from like nineteen eighty five yknow sit there and tinker on those and then once month we ll have a leadership module which is uh the business ethics part and yknow set goal setting and that type thing and then once month we ll just have like donatos pizza and like just just discuss basic and just general things we ll like events coming up we had we planted the flowers at murfield last weekend and the weekend before was it two i don know i can wait for it to start just because i want to watch it on tv and like i planted those you see the the nick jack nicholas golf statue in front of the clubhouse i planted the flowers around that no i i don want to watch it for the golf at all i just want turn it on and see it occasionally yep yeah i probably will yeah um yeah actually they had just posted something on the in on the email today they have these old machines that used to be uh they re called three twos and a and used to run on them and they re just really old and i mean just ridiculously like seventies just ridiculous and he giving them out but the only thing is if you take one you have to finish like you have to um install a disk drive and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i thinking i may get into that for like summer project or something i like this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because it more interesting it a lot more practical yknow it little more problem solving less running around and shooting things yknow um it like problem solving type yknow little puzzles it not as much sit in front of a tv and be entertained it you create your own entertainment no um it an ego trip that all basically it like look i can do this you know i was sitting down uh in my boyfriend room and my roommate was sitting up in my room alone and i had my computer on but nobody was sitting at it and um from downstairs we broke into my computer and started playing uh threes like while she was studying or something i think we played this homer simpson stuff she she got so mad it was so worth it she the type of person i love to annoy my roommate we have uh yeah we have typical dorm room uh we have um desks and then lofted beds you have the option take your bed down i had to take mine down because i broke my ankle fall quarter so it still just sitting down and my computer sits next to it um the only thing is if you take it down you can only have half a desk that still enough for me a place for computer to sit and my plants sit in the corner and then i have my little paper stack mm you should uh you should be organized i not i have this stack of like groceries maybe about a foot high sitting next to my bed just when we out and bought groceries and then the commons open again oh they it was nice actually i ate a lot more healthy and um it was cheaper i was getting money on my buck i so i actually got paid every day yeah they gave us nine dollars a day it was like nine twenty five for what meal plan i was on so then um we bought like pop tarts and that lasted for like a week of breakfast for two bucks yknow you can beat that and then um uh which which the the as far as the the violence there well there the whole thing about the police chief and then there the whole thing about um about the laws the federal lawsuit against columbus well just chief ja of the thing about chief jackson i don he i he i not real up on this i know that um he done some things and i don know i kn i don know if it was drugs or some i something ridiculous that that a lot of people and i think a lot of the the police force and a lot of other officials are are pretty much in agreement that he should resign and he feels like like he just not going to and that we don have any um we that the mayor can nobody can actually make him resign that that something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as yknow dorothy was teater was saying i gonna make him do this which is something that she doesn have any power to do um and about how how they just continue to get raises and they re and they re not doing very much about it and and less than fifty percent of the police force is actually in police cars and and a lot people are doing desk jobs and those types of things and i guess a lot of people just aren very happy with the job he been doing and he just says yknow i don i do don whether you like me or not i don care i gonna keep working i don know but i think it was something it was something real shady that he that he got into and i knew that i don know if it was i think it was like cocaine or some i don something wa i don i don know i mean something that was pretty shady yeah and i don know if it quite that bad but it was certainly some things that he been doing that aren aren approved of and i not real up on that so isn that it that almost worse though that it not even a surprise oh my god right um hum um hum give us a job sure is wrong with him yeah yknow i think a lot of times uh you yknow people aren real rational as far as as who they they go for but i can certainly i can certainly see that and that mih i think that yknow lot of th a lot of people feel like too oh he he he one us yknow he like he like we are kind of thing well michigan it a ten year mandatory jail time sentence if you get caught with any cocaine at all ten years no question about it that it you re in jail for ten years eighteen years old if you ve got anything on ten years that it yknow and you look at some of these other people or like these sports people and they get caught with that stuff or have ih and nothing happens and it just sets such a horrible example that here you ve got you know some regular some eighteen year old kid that does something really stupid and he ten years in jail and then you ve got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can be elected well yknow and you just it just it so it so wrong yeah well i don even know what to sih what a disgrace it embarrassing it really yeah i did i did i mean i think he done some positive things that whole thing about um eh eh as far as like your student loans and being able to get into into which has helped me yknow and i thi yknow all this that ae as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy things i think have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i don i don know i mean it i don know if if it really if you really it i feel like that they re that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with really yknow and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they don they don ever really put anything into action they just kind of skate along yknow and i don know if there anything substantial i can say and that was a wonderful thing that you did that i feel very affected by it um economy fine i mean so ah it it not that he not that he doing a horrible job but i don really know how much he actually doing yknow and i think that unfortunately spend a lot of your time trying to get out of out of personal issues that you ve gotten yourself into and you can really focus on anything that that positive that you wanna do for for the country and i think i think it just too bad because i feel like if i was president uh not that i wanna be president but yknow you have three or four things that you think were very important you you hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very competent that you feel like they actually be able to accomplish some things and you really work to get some stuff done yknow and i don know if it if it just because yknow you have to get agreement from all the other all the everybody else in government before you can pass anything or or why yknow why don these things get taken care of i mean there so many different issues that people wanna look at and end up focusing on things like philip morris yknow which is like the biggest thing in the whole world yknow and and there so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are that are important i just i don know maybe i mean i don i don i not real up on everything that been done but i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused and you and you would be able to say yknow this is what there these three things that i think are really important that i really gonna work to make sure that they get taking care of and and i don i just think people kind of la dee da it and say well this is it like this yknow well we ll see what we can kind of do about it and then we ll yknow right yeah i mean but i mean we re not at a depression and and the yknow the employment rate is fine and healthcare is we ve got some improvements there and like i said that that student loan this is big yknow uh but i just i mean so i wouldn say he done a a a horrible horrible job but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we ve wasted but we could have spent that money on something else yknow and you end up doing that yeah i usually don not quite there not really yeah yeah i i don i don really yeah i haven i i really haven even haven even given it that much thought yet once they start running those then i ll kind of kind of read up on it but i haven not really okay that fine i think ah i i perfectly content um hum um hum uh huh um hum um hum right uh huh uh huh what instrument do you play um uh hum uh hum i play the french horn i don think i said that before and i sing tenor and mostly choir stuff but i ve done a few small solo things uh hum well that what everybody when i tell i play that what everybody says but it seems to me that any instrument can be depending i mean i can see how anybody can play a clarinet for example but there some things that are hard about playing the french horn one is that you can play many different notes with a single fingering and you just it ear related being able to play is related to how well how well you can hear and how well you can project what what you want to hear into how you form your mouth and what comes out right right it not an analytical process it analytical in the sense of controlling your mouth and and your hand in the bell and that kind of thing to get what you want to come out but it not analytic analytical in terms of finger combinations no not so much right it bad it on the other hand it not good to let your mind wander off i find myself having to focus sometimes and to really uh hum yeah when i first went to oberlin i was a performance major in french horn and looking back on it i wish i maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my my teaching possibilities and although i certified to teach now in chemistry and uh earth science um it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also i could i could it might take me uh a year or two just for the courses that i need yeah it is it is and there nothing to guarantee that i wouldn have the same result which isn to say that someday i won get back into teaching but um i might uh well it harder than i think in some ways than people think um i went to the teach ohio fair last year to look around and didn didn see that much interest in uh chemistry or general science teachers um i think the market has is fluctuated back to a point where they don need as many right now they re not clamoring for us um hum uh um hum yeah i just renewed my certificate last year so i may get back into part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can arrange with a student that is at home for some reason um i had one that just had a baby and um they it an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover the most technical i guess subject that the student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once and i it was the algebra two another but they expected us to at least expected me uh to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history so really requires you to be well rounded and i i like kind of like um i ve taught in a couple of other places um community colleges the college in newark i taught a chemistry class there and the community college which is in hillsboro but i taught at their branch and i taught a an introduction to ecology class an introduction to uh introduction to the arts it was called and that was interesting it was those are it kind of an underclass of teachers they don pay you enough to do that they pay you um per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty two dollars an hour yeah they don pay you for any of that no no they didn um didn pay for grading or preparing your classes or or researching so right but but still even though it was real very much underpaid job i i liked it when i did it um i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to develop my own curriculum for it they had a when they told me i i they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book that was about this thick and it was only about and i looked at it i thought introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broader than so i ended up coming up with a class that was it was an only nine weeks too it was only nine classes um so was about a two and a half or three hour class each week for nine weeks and uh i ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting mostly uh visual art and for the second three weeks we talked about music and the uh development of music various aspects and for the last three weeks we talked about theater actually for the two of the last three weeks we talked about theater and for the last week we talked about musical theater and opera so for a lot of these kids you know from it was an introduction to uh it was an introduction to a lot of they may might not have been exposed to yeah yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised uh which class was this in i think this was in that introduction to the arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in class thought it was very hard i didn think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty note at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at this school before that my class and i was giving her a and she was her average was going to be ruined and she hoped i felt guilty about it not really not really i mean i was grading on a pretty much of a too i mean i was trying really not to flunk anybody that was that was attempting to do the work uh i think i flunked one person that was really goofing off and uh but in terms of a curve i had as i had bs i had a few yeah so yep oh well yeah yeah it might be um hum um hum um hum right right and and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to tell a teacher i to get an a what wrong with you what wrong with you let see usually go out to lunch at like fast food place and then we get together and cook dinner yeah we have a little kitchen uh i ve learned a lot about cooking lately i i thought in the beginning i missed mirror lake cafe so bad because the good subs and all that i don i don know why i missed them i don i go back and now i just don like it anymore yeah i ve been thoroughly spoiled yknow like catfish biff subs those are oh the they they re very good like you call i usually just call and then i walk down and by the time i get there the subs are ready oh is it it a little farther yeah no not really i don know what even is to eat down here oxleys oxleys is probably the closest place and those little hot dog stands those really don count which one is that yeah adriatico um hum mondays and tuesdays they have cheap pizza yeah they have a deal monday and tuesday i think it like after five the ch cheap pizzas really cheap yeah yeah that wouldn work our dorms were cleaner our our janitor is worthless basically it we were complaining about it like earlier during the year three complaints have uh formal complaints have been filed against him and he still refuses to change the bleach water like more than once a week it really disgusting so we had these temps come in one day and it was we went in uh like we re in shock it was so clean they did they didn come every but yknow they came occasionally and it helped and we mopped our own floor like on the hall a few times it we just basically need the bathrooms done yknow and i wouldn be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here you know i don i don know commons i don i didn miss bus service i kind of missed because um aaron car is out on west campus but i went home and got my dad a he teaches in the dental school but he only teaches on fridays so he has that a pass available all the time so our car is parked next to the building yeah we re gonna have to give it up by friday because the strike over they won let us keep it anymore oh i wish yeah i do it during summer too i usually work down here just over summer and i use the a pass and then i drive my dad down on fridays yeah i thi they re justified to go on strike anytime they want to however how they behaved during the strike was just i mean like sitting out the street all the time like uh honking the horns ringing the bells doing the the really annoying chants um i had classes in the and building that we just had to cancel because they were too loud um yeah across streets the dental and the hospital so people were really loud down there and we couldn have class in addition they were like trying to tip over buses and throwing stones at them when they drove by i guess there no need to attack students over it and i read some article in the lantern i don know why i read that but um i hate that paper but anyway um i read some article that the guy said he not trying to attack students he just wants them to get annoyed so they ll whine to their parents about how the university does it and then they can all fight the establishment and it makes me angry that people like that even get money no it didn as a matter of fact i told my parents yknow university is handling it so well by giving them the money because they don deserve it yknow and yeah yeah um it was just disgusting how they a lot of yelling at that was unnecessary i they just totally approached it from the wrong point and i mean there were some students that actually supporting them and they were being very vocal about it but the vast majority of people that i talked to were so against the strikers yeah they were for pro strike were getting money on buck i but yeah we wanted it to keep on going but they just didn need to do like that and then i think once they noticed that the uh commons were gonna open without them they realized that university is functioning or was functioning fine without them and decided to go back to their jobs i if you noticed the first time that they voted they voted down this proposal the proposal that their voting on this week is the exact same one uh nobody really admits it but oh i grabbed the paper because i wanted to see what the agreement was and it pretty much the same thing and they voting positively for it this time i wouldn i wouldn doubt it i hope they vote against it but i don think they will just because it been three weeks now yknow and not only that there uh something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and union has to pay their full wages for the work that they miss union not gonna do that yeah hm yeah i just think you can you can call for across the board raises there definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than what they re getting and there are some people that deserve to be fired and there no way that you can really differentiate just because they re in a union they take that it really unfortunate for the good workers in there because i mean the people at mirror lake are so yeah they re all yknow and work hard yknow to make it easier on the students yknow totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year just to make it easier on everybody it good place they even stopped playing the ghetto music they had this jukebox and it was they played the same three songs with like horribly offensive lyrics and melody whatsoever they stopped doing that now yeah probably i just think it horribly biased paper they don really take their what is it like integrity they don take that seriously oh it most of it is liberal and they always find some way misrepresent like kirwan they always find some silly way to slant his words and make him bad and it really disgusting i yeah yeah since it not sponsored officially by university they can do whatever they want and they don have any um i looking for a word here uh repercussions no they re not it printed at the top every on every issue that they are financially seperate independent so therefore they can they re not public they can put whatever they want i am during different points of the day i don as far as affiliated with a party i respond republicans more than democrats i think given any um given any choice of any party at all i probably more libertarian than anything else just yknow it let people make their own mistakes and then but don make me pay for it yeah are as i fink you were implying those are two those people but they aren uh so how do we correct some of this you ve got to get i think we ve got to cut out a lot of this luxury we ve got to slowly bring quote that family back home uh and i don necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man who cares in today work uh world far less agriculturally related uh we re far more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation uh so uh a man and uh uh a ma or a wom me me frephrase a woman can do most of the work that being done outside of the home today versus what they could ve done as agricultural people uh and so once again though that would people back to this central family make up this has to be communications communications as it going uh that it irreversible uh a and i think it can be redirected in much in the manner she speaking uh and uh and where does this start i think it has start back here in first grade i think parents must participate with teachers uh as we used to uh was just common uh you could walk in and sit down and uh watch the students or participate with participate and or assist uh well they have these ca assistants but they re hired directed assistants they re not in there portraying or passing their their values of the community to the students uh so i think that i guess i mu must i will continue to come back to family to family almost everything has got to be come back to family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis very very much so now fifty fifty twenty fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would call we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism well in the manner we dis describe define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we re no longer a cutoff duma democratic government as defined back there then uh yeah we re still democratic according to our new definition of this developed over time uh but it far more socialistic uh but um hum yeah there almost nobody anymore that willing to do uh just uh miniscule things unless you re gonna get paid for it uh it just always money money money money money money money money uh but just uh okay um hum uh this is my senior year i graduating in june i a spanish major i had psychology class i had one that counts for anything so i know a little bit about yknow a like yknow studies little yeah i had i had fun i enjoyed it one my my favorite classes actually for for an elective uh it was uh professor uh it was it it was interesting i mean it it it lot it lots to remember a lot of terminology but i enjoyed it like yeah like like five hundred people in lecture hall yeah i grew up in columbus i went to uh um uh just about just a little uh east of here in high school what called high school where you from where you where you originally from that okay via via that a round round about way of there what you do in australia were you really that awesome wow but you taught psychology oh wow how you hook up with that oh you just you just happened just a job that an awesome job oh my gosh that awesome there there a lot of stuff to do down there if you like outdoors i bet i if you to come back to this weather i would do i would is there really i ve seen the um big amphitheater and with that uh the what is that the opera house yeah right right on the right on there was the ocean or whatever it gorgeous ah i can i can believe you came oh oh that why okay is there really they re more laid back um hum they re like the are they all like the people on crocodile dundee where they just no they just like okay oh is that right they re kind of like more isolated here and parochial is that right it got more cosmopolitan because heck yknow it a it sydney it is uh that like a that like a tourist place is that right oh okay because they got beaches and and yeah yeah i it like i don think lake erie can i would hurt um hum is that right they got they got all that white sand and uh uh yknow that that water can see down for miles and uh yeah it probably not as yknow like yknow as uh condensed and packed as like most tourist areas because like in australia a little out of the way yes yknow yknow spend some time to get there as ya like you like you would florida california so it like if you wanna go to the beach you don always say oh like memorial day it like forget it yknow just forget it it like but with australia at least you don have to worry about yknow fighting the tourists is that right well a lot of all the places got these like little well known hiding spots yknow like try to keep them like a a like a a secret away from the tourists before they yknow overrun the place once the tourists hear about it yknow it like yknow it like yknow like some of these places in florida kind like ruined by tourists yknow like fort lauderdale daytona yeah it like after after the kids get done yknow they just like yknow forget it it like i because um i used to when i was in in um like a freshman um i heard i heard like don even go to florida because like they they do not want students yknow they want your but they don like they don like your they don like yknow the the trash and and the whatnot that they bring yeah exactly so they so i i said well if yknow i went to i went to uh padre island i didn want to pick it and yknow it in texas so it out on the gulf is that that a nice beach but nothing nothing that probably would compare to yours in australia gosh oh in the city um oh that was probably awesome i haven either i never knew that they had so many beaches i mean i know that had a good reputation yknow for for like just just just yknow just having a great vacation time because nobody ever came back was ready to tell oh yeah this place was terrible yknow the weather was bad yknow that people were people were rude everybody there they would say so ah you gotta go you gotta go yes it yknow it a long flight but it well worth the time what the hell am i doing here is that right i just i just love i love i just love those koala bears just to see a koala bear i go yknow there just like little teddy bears bring them bring them bring one home to your daughter say here is a little playbabies here your broth here your ba here a baby brother for you really do they ah they look so sweet and cuddly yknow just like just like something you just want to take home really what do they eat that it ah uh huh is that right oh my gosh it a wonder they re not like yknow falling out of trees that why they have such sharp sharp claws i guess so they can lock in you mean one of those you had one of those hit your head that would hurt kamikaze koalas so is that like is that like in the parks yknow like yknow we like grand canyon yknow you can feed them yknow yknow like junk food and mcdonalds is that right big ball of fur do they have like little babies they carry in their pouches like kangaroos ah isn that cute like a little papoose you had to go to a zoo actually okay i thought they just be out walking around yknow oh really that cute oh that right i forgot you guys have like a big kangaroo population ya yknow like ohio has like yknow all these deer and stuff so it like they have do guys like like shoot them have like kangaroo season okay that kind of the tail okay really so do kangaroos actually bounce or is that just yknow oh they do really okay really are they friendlier other than than the koalas yeah can you go up and like feed them and um hum do you have like any friendly animals whatsoever in ko in australia yknow like we have we have bears in in in america it like it like well if they if they see if you don make a child support payment they should do the same thing i don know why they don have a system like that yeah i think that probaba yknow i i not that familiar with it now but i think that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that the people fall through yeah that right right yep but uh fifty dollars a week yknow you can do anything for fifty dollars a week yknow you could work two two hours a day yknow for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids is really not that much a week so that be two hundred dollars a month yeah that was the most somebody could be um ordered to pay being unemployed and i think yeah eighty four yeah so they adjusted that but then they didn have any way to um enforce that so yeah well i was gonna say i i ve seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to being home and the husbands support them and in those situations they still want them to they still don want to go out there and do that and um and yknow they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there alimony and all that kind of thing and and that can be detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and yknow and he does have a responsibility but i think there can be a line drawn to how responsible he is and how capable the other half would have been yknow right right oh yeah yeah yeah well there too many situations out there to have everybody fit in to certain ones that just everyone of them different not really no i was too proud i would have never i would have never i think my dad paid my first month rent for me though i paid him back and then i never i never wanted to borrow any money i guess just growing up the youngest of five i appreciated money and i didn even want yknow and i knew my mom is like if she can save a nickel somewhere yknow she will so i knew that that how they were and i didn want to yknow it was my choice to get married it was my choice to have kids and yknow i didn i didn feel the need to ask them um well i think yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah they re ok they re parents they re in their seventies now i i take what i need and leave the rest because they ve got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine so uh my brother lives in connecticut um and he uh with a cement company concrete i not even really sure i ve never even seen him where he lives seen pictures and he comes and visits a lot but i ve never gone up there um and his wife an opera singer so she real busy and they they just are madly in love he got divorced after seventeen years of marriage and found the wife that he has now they ve been married for probably almost oh i don know seven eight years and they re real happy and his kids are grown and they have kids and yeah the family is really pretty big the immediate family just us is thirty two with our husband wives and kids yeah so then i have another sister that was married to a doctor and just recently divorced she one of the ones that wants to stay and it unfair yknow life is unfair nothing ever works and so um she living in akron in a house completely paid for by herself and lives out in the middle of nowhere and complains how lonely she is then i told her if it was me completely alone i be in the middle of a city somewhere yknow where you see people and i don know yknow it just you can always see what someone else should do or could do whatever i she always trying to recruit people to come and visit but it like a two hour drive and then everybody busy yknow that four hours of driving and um i don know it just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way but yeah i have two other sisters um one of them is well it funny because we re all divorced out the five of us we re all on one of them is on her third marriage and we re all on our second except for one she divorced and she hasn remarried and then my oldest that i told you in akron i guess she not remarried yeah four girls um hum yeah and then my other sister just recently got divorced um this year or i guess it was um final end of last year and she got two kids and raising them and so they re all um most of them except for um linda and bobby bobby the one in uh connecticut and linda in akron but everybody else is within ten minutes of each other ten fifteen minutes so yeah we stay pretty close see each other a lot yeah and i closer to the ones that that feel the same way i do about my oldest sister yknow i can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i don stay on very long with her oh its real negative she real negative about things and and tries to put me down for being positive or yknow i always see a way out of something and she doesn and she i think she gets kind of mad and plus she is feels like she old at fifty and i said oh my gosh you don even have any bad habits i said yknow you could live to be a hundred that fifty more years yknow i mean if you look at it that way she really yknow fifty is not old at all to me i mean that just you as much as you learn yknow you can trade but yeah my my one sister that um exactly seven years older than me we re the closest and then the sister that two years older than me she the same way she does a lot of things that i like why are you doing that yknow don do so she she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes through but oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because uh nobody is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it great because uh we just go to a shelter inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and yeah and then you can stay as long as you want you don yknow feel obligated and everybody just brings in food yknow everybody brings their own stuff and it fun we ve yeah it is from thanksgiving to christmas i mean it just nonstop family everywhere so it fun not me it too expensi oh yeah i contributed to too many people there too many people there not enough committment it too easy to get divorced and it uh the competition i mean there just tons and tons of um just people everywhere and young people today i don i yknow i don know what the statistics are gonna be but they i don think they have a good idea of what marriage even is yknow before and also before a marriage was a committment to a type of lifestyle and that lifestyle gone everybody independent everybody going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and is equally as independent then the might it might work but um i yknow and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh oh yeah yeah yeah i know i was really young when i met my husband i was fourteen in high school so we kind of grew up together and i didn know anything else and um just two complete different people yknow different needs and everything else so yeah well i didn realize that until i had kids and i had two little girls and i thought wait a minute yknow i my whole life changed because my committment was to them and to yknow get all the opportunities that were out there for them and and it just didn happen that yknow well that we both had the same he wanted everything to be the same yknow so i think that really changed everything one could have it does you re whole focus changes because everything you say somebody listening and everything you want to do somebody watching and so it a good money maker uh that right well we they don they don they don give them uh i don know maybe they give each one free ticket or something the rest of them have to yeah yeah um hum um hum yeah but that those are those tend to be my least favorite concerts although our conductor tries hard to make it interesting for orchestra members by bringing in some music but it that interesting challenging or whatever for orchestra he um we re lucky to have him he who a associate conductor for the uh columbus symphony um hum um hum he he very good i i glad that we have him as a conductor i was in the orchestra when we selected him we auditioned think five four or five conductors over the course of the year we had each one for a different concert and we up picking him yeah they weren all they weren all columbus some of them sort of flew in visited for for the job is a bit of prestige um was won some competition a couple years ago about uh upcoming in the the right that true that true um hum right that true sometimes we have trouble finding enough violists or something yknow an instrument like that um but they they usually get enough to play a concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for the last few rehearsals um hum so we sort of have stringers i guess you call yeah we ve actually been on also uh radio on music um our last year yeah of beethoven ninth got on music in mid ohio yeah we used the college choir um it is it um hum um hum um hum there there there some things ah opera i have a picture that in my head with the big the it a neat acoustics really shocking um hum oh my um hum um hum well speaking of acoustics i i don know i you ll have to tell me if i going off the subject or yknow if you need to ask me something else um this is another interesting story my church choir is very important of the up there on have you ever been to the church up there should visit sometime although you re only to be here for another month summer is not necessarily the best time to visit but um just to see the church might be fun um we about how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build a new worship center building and because we were really too too big for the sanctuary that we had and um so basically they decided to build a new building adjacent to the church tacked on and we they asked the choir for input as to what the sanctuary should be so had a tour uh the choir took a tour our choir director um arranged it to about six five or six churches in the columbus area to in them not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones liked the of and uh that was interesting we sang in uh we sang in downtown which was this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we didn maybe it had some feedback i think the acoustically very good it much than old worship center because i don know if you ve seen a picture or anything of the church the old worship center was designed by a modern architect to be a modern quote unquote type building in nineteen sixty and it it it flat there a with a clear story in the middle it has in it just empty over the over the worship center when you would sing in that as a choir you spread out along the front if you were under the high place your go all way to but if you were this flat ceiling that only about seven or that only about nine or ten feet high was it was and um it was yknow we made do for many years and then um and then we had the the to get this input into this new and it it uh it really beautiful it a circular almost circular big uh space with a point in the of the roof and uh it it you could still go it they won have they won a lot of um music during the summer but they ll have regular worship service i think they re at ten on i lot of times skip during the summer um hum um hum um hum um hum right right but how old is your you could but you could take her to oh okay well the reason i asked was a lot it to me a lot of impetus for going to or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school starting questions about religion and you re saying well i suppose i could answer all of these but yeah right you go to right i started going to ch ah sunday school when i was five or six years old um i i was raised in the sunday school of this church up here yeah yes um a long time member in fact i think i may be about the longest term member of the right now yeah i sang in the there when i was in high school back in nineteen seventy so that thirty years ago yeah yep um right right right it it getting a little more common nowadays but it still i the church gets most of its members from as converts recovering right recovering you name it yeah um hum um wow uh huh um hum well i have i have two that are southern baptist ministers and it used to be when we would visit them in the mid sixties we would have to go i mean if you visit your relative if your relatives you re minister you go to and uh but the thing is is southern baptist um service always has that period where you re mm hmm well i now i i can only speak for my relationship now my dad was uh out of town quite a bit when we were growing up so uh from a maternal aspect yknow mom was there all the time and uh and a lot of times she filled the the male and the female the mother and the father role yknow as far punishment and everything like that but uh uh it would i i know in my it would ve been a lot better i think for for and everything yknow i mean for yknow we would ve been able to uh joint custody with her and yknow when she growing up because a well by her being out there i mean yknow you can just imagine she yknow and being a girl not saying girl anything bad about being my daughter yknow worrying about things in school and weekends and like that so where if i was closer to i wouldn worry so much about it so um well i know uh when she reached twelve something like that uh in the twelve thirteen range you know she became real violent with mom um threatening her and like that and uh her all i have to is get on the and there and yknow i can out there in about hours yknow so i don know what problem is you need to get either talk to me it talk to your mom about it or go see somebody else and talk to them about it but yknow you need to get it out of your off chest and a lot of it bitterness of the she did go and a uh a psychia like a child or something and it and it she was real bitter about the divorce feeling that she kinda the cause of um hum to i had a conversation with about it said you know you didn cause anything yknow me and your mother caused it all nyi anything you were the spot of the marriage so and that where you got to look at when you see that in the mirror remember that yknow um hum um hum then she blow up on me too yknow a couple three times but on the phone and and then i i sit there and say well you go ahead and yknow you can me every name in the book do whatever the heck you want to but i still your you can take that away me so well yknow like you said i think they just go a lot of i mean i had a lot of uh animosity my dad for things that happened yknow um perhaps not being there when i was yknow younger and like that and uh anything me and my brother got of it yknow he three older than me and then uh but but yknow yknow i don have they they re both not my parents have away but uh yknow i don any animosity them at all yknow kinda like it kind of like a up thing i i guess yknow i mean you you kinda there and say yeah you yknow you did the you could yknow i mean um hum then you either it or you don and i mean um hum see i was the second generation of because he like he was like some old when i born so the thing he wanted another kid um hum um hum um hum um hum of them are all the above um hum and uh some of them aren there quite a few of them that have adjusted well to uh when they came home biggest i think when uh what what happened that there wasn any like world and ever yknow it like you came got the plane and yknow nobody really yknow um hum um hum um well i i got one buddy that that that meets all the criteria and and uh might seem quite a on the street and yknow and uh and he he me to take him and get him and everything but yknow i keep saying yknow you re the one who got to help man yknow you got to give up the war yknow and uh and he like fifty and uh i him down here every now and then yknow yknow he drinks all the time to try to ease the and the really should have been done gone by as as he in his yknow so i think there a lot of people can use that an excuse yknow think that that you with all the violence in the schools and that sort of thing i think people are starting to look at it a little differently yeah and it not i mean it gets it any is too much but it not that big a proportion that it happening but i remember even my son the third grade somebody kid brought a gun to school yeah he went to columbus schools uh uh and the kid didn know what he had he just found it laying around his father car in the glove compartment brought it in to show the other kids uh that was very upsetting to my son he very sensitive uh he used to be again i don know if that normal for teenagers or not but he used used to be very sensitive to other people and but uh i don think i i don know if he is or he just doesn won let him be himself be right now but right uh oh yeah and that normal we understood that we ka knew we knew a lot of stuff we were gonna we raised him to be very independent and i always said that we re gonna regret this someday i said another ten years we ll be pleased but uh we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or i to be very independent uh so it gets to point that when we were first married pretty it was hard to make it simple decision on anything yknow we ve worked through that after twenty five years but uh or to stand on our own or anything but you know we learned to do it but we always he was always very independent his teachers said independent we said it said stubborn but it like even go to mcdonalds or something and he was didn want onions on anything he if he ordered a a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as six and seven years old and and tell them uh which we encouraged that because we could know that he ll need that someday i would never have done it but it uh he he would he and he very opinionated and it interesting when he talks about uh anything he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing uh you can tell that he thought he uh thought about it and his yknow clearly formulated what his stance is on it and he very articulate about it uh sometimes his responses are immature but he nineteen i mean i sure at nineteen i was saying some really bizarre things too uh but you can tell that he thought about it so because he and i always discuss politics and stuff he had va a variety uh eighth grade is when he was probably in some ways his better year uh he was taking a com had taken computer class for grading period and um it wasn going well they were teaching keyboarding well he learned that when he was in third grade so we were talking to the teacher about it says well he disruptive he supposed be doing keyboarding exercises and he writing programs so anyways and he said i knew the first day he was in here he knew every th thing that i was gonna teach this couldn do grading period well that kind of flew up a red flag to me and can you give him other assignments oh no he got do what everybody else is doing so we went to the principal and i was president of the uh parent advisory committee at the time so i had an easy access to the principal he took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library and the librarian worked with him one on one teaching data base and spreadsheet uh applications to him but then but he had another teacher in the ninth grade who contacted us his english teacher and he she se said told us uh said he knows everything i wanna teach so i want your permission to give him a separate curriculum and she did she but he was using reading books like invisible man my ellimen ellison ralph ellison and ellimen guess it is anyway um and writing papers on it he was reading like three books by an author and then trying to write a short story in that author style and she still tested him with the other kids just make sure she hadn missed any he hadn missed anything and she was he was using her grad school notes to write papers and stuff like this and uh it was he loved it and that what he needed though when he got to high school and we would talk to teachers about they said no they couldn do that uh it was very frustrated frustrating in the kin in uh first grade his teacher knew that he needed that but the principal would not allow her to do it and that one reason we put him in different school for second grade uh right yeah and uh in the eighth grade he took the ninth grade proficiency test and passed all four parts the first time uh so he was learning what they were teaching which and that another problem teaching to a test but um that a whole different problem uh right and you learn what you have to to get through the test course i did that when i was here at school uh if was a class i knew i had to take i didn really want to that what you do uh you just get through it uh um hum yeah i was bored in high school and i wasn all that bright and uh he needed that but uh if i uh it it was difficult uh i can tell you how many times he had papers or projects due at school that we just have to sit there with him to keep him focused on doing it it one of the uh diagnosises probably a which has trouble with uh working memory how and how to get a project done and stuff like that uh we taught him how to do time lines and gat charts and things like that um but it was very difficult for him be task oriented and it still is uh and that was the problem with school he just wouldn do the work i mean he give him a test and he could pass it do really well but he just wouldn do the work well he wasn really diagnosed then until just the last couple years uh and part of the problem was it was fairly new and everybody was being diagnosed a uh and it wasn really there weren really good screening instruments for that there are now uh and we ve often felt that he needed to have gifted emphasis for gifted children because uh and the uh the schools wouldn do that for him because his grades weren good enough because he didn do the work and the state of ohio definition of a gifted child is uh anyone who goes scores seventy percent or higher on some test that they give well uh yknow they saying half the students in columbus schools were gifted students now that not it can it impossible gifted students there fourteen different characteristics to look at you can just look at one thing and one of them they looked at in columbus was uh how well he was doing in school well gifted children you ofte have the high uh one of the highest drop rate of out rates in schools they re not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this moneys uh mu my feeling is you know there lot of programs in school there sponsored by the federal government particularly uh to help the the students are that are behind and that important and it should be important but there needs the students that are the other end need the help too lot of people think if you have a child that gifted that all your problems are solved but it not it a different set of problems there personality quirks that go with that emotional issues right and the they re not willing to do that for gifted students only if for those students who are achu high achievers who are very bright talented may be truly gifted who are willing to jump through the hoops and those the and the other students were lost to the system and that what happened with him and and it just yeah well we figure in a few years he will um that what we figure in a few years he ll be fine it just getting there it been very difficult i mean there times when we didn know where he was for a week at tay a week at a time he i was driving lane avenue once and saw him begging money on the street and that it it hit pretty heavy load to go through it really is right no i had no idea where he was uh and at the time my mother in law was in a nursing home had alzheimers and my father in law was in the hospital uh essentially dying and so we were dealing with all of this at the same time and it was i mean there was one night i remember we were ready to leave the hospital about seven thirty we checked to see if there was any messages at home to see if we heard from him uh and got a message that my mother in law had fallen and she was in an emergency room the same hospital fortunately so went down there then on the way home got a phone call on the cell phone uh from the hospital that my father in law had to had some bleeding so we had to go back to hospital and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was all and this was not unusual it was a horrible period and uh i think what made my wife and i the angriest was that he the only one that really could control his behavior the others couldn and their needs were immediate he admits now that he felt neglected at that period well how he felt and knowing that weren neglecting him were two different things we ve always emphasized that knowing what right or knowing that what just is one thing it dealing with the emotions is another one like dealing the with this adoption of the baby we know that that best but dealing with the emotions of it this is a you know it grand we re very family oriented and it this is a grandchild we ll never see and it very hard on my wife and i but we ll get through it right yeah it uh well you re right yes so it tough to go through but he uh i guess he always did take things a little on the extreme so it probably wasn unexpected we just weren prepared for it i don think you could be prepared for it right and he just pretty much cut ties with all of his old friends and we still see them all uh a lot and we were close with their parents and hasn for about four years he refuses to refuses to live with us because we have rules he seemed confused parenting with controling i mean we would like when he was fourteen years old we wouldn let him go out and take a walk at el three in the morning and he couldn understand that i i don think that being a bad parent to tell you no uh of uh all the off campus kids to like to the police and so like they start driving around around ten thirty try and bust them for noise on the weekends so it pretty hectic yeah exactly that what it a very conservative town and the and it a very it seems to be a fairly conservative uh university as well so yeah i think if i make the transfer i ll definitely be happy about it definitely like politically is that what ch oh well like um like i was in high school i was involved in like the democratic in the democratic campaign and just stuff like that just uh i like to do something i learning about the environment because this job but i like to do something otherwise like a a lot of like business leaders uh they re very they become very conservative when they get higher up because like the tax breaks they wanna support things like that but i think there should be a good mix like uh th there there could still be like a think tank of of executives that could be very liberal and they re thinking and just you know for social for social not so much social change but you know not not um encouraging sweat shops within the corporations thu stuff like that and i like to ge i don know how i would get involved in something like that but i would like to it be interesting that would be neat that be real neat but that dream world so i have to get a job and support myself so that ll come later maybe when i retire way way in the future i don know i would like to think i like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that i cause that what happens to a lot of them yknow they beco they come out of school all idealistic and then they go into industry and then they re molded and assuming they make upper management there you want the tax breaks you want thing you know what i mean and then they uh like i have an uncle who a vice president on wall street for merrill lynch and he said you know he he got out of school he was very idealistic but now he he he like all those people they should you know i i made it through myself and he not for like the you know but realistically he didn but you lose sight of that i think you know what i mean and lot of these guys become real egotistical i mean i like my uncle and everything but you know you know what i mean no not at all i think in the united states it the driving force of our of our of our government and and even like cause without without a revenue base from the taxes of corporations the you couldn have nearly the things that we ve had and i think to a degree they ve become fairly powerful but i don think that necessarily a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because that supported th supported the person but you could if you have good relations with your labor you don necessarily need a union and a lot times unions uh they akchisiy actually seem detrimental like to production and to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union because the if the union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and like that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees these lazy a lazy union as representative of of these workers so they re more apt outside yeah i was i was driving by the the honking and everything so yeah my roommates and i got into a a debate about it but it we didn really resolve it because conceivably they wanted uh what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like exercise that that ri yeah like they all get the option but i i understand very few exercise it so you know if you were to not give them the the tuition that they could that most of them are using and then give them the two dollars an hour you know the but then that could then you could say that helping to keep people down and so you have to still it a it an odd balance there it is and like uh it something like that doesn seem too skilled to me so the i don really know why there much of a union for that but yeah obviously the yeah it does it not like a skilled profession to me i think yeah the protection um hum yeah there no distinction oh they were helping out the the new oh yeah but he has to still support the union so yeah that that a rough place to be in but a does the union like when people go on strike does the union help support the people that aren getting paid then or oh i see um hum really yeah yeah that that interesting really broke the the strike if you re part of the union and you just decided to go back and say forget it they can pay you yeah and i don see too many people working for free so um in general i i think the united states has a fairly well developed like class not like class structure in which you can move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class um sector and i think that a good sign but i think there a huge there millions of children that don have any healthcare and that not right there like there a lot of like between the lower and the upper there a huge disparity but at least it a step in the right direction we have a a nice solid middle inclung middle inco middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visited mexico and seems like they only had the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that uh but that economy is coming along too and i mean it it ll be it developing itself which is which is nice i took a tour of a plant down there cause my my old my old man had business down there so i went down just to see it and like it it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day but they get si they get bused into work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because there like like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because i was talking to the the one of the managers and he said if we don do that then they won be thinking about the our quality and they ll be thinking about getting food and they ll be hungry so it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and i i like to see that implemented something like that in the united states that be a neat thing you know because like i know like iron foundries and uh some like like the lower paying jobs like they have people that are illiterate and things like that and they can like give paychecks out on thursdays because everyone will call off on fridays cause they all go out and get drunk or i don know what they do with their pay checks i know that a big problem but like if you said i we ll have a bus service we ll go and pick you guys up you know and then then you can use the excuse my car broke down or something and then like if you even you give them a like doesn even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you re on three shifts you can just you know here the box of donuts and some milk or something you know that doesn cost the company that much con compared to you you ll have more loyalty i would think and at the same time those people won be thinking about being hungry while they re on the line working for you so yeah exactly you can bring that in house i think i mean i don know i might go out like like we said and be completely wrong so yeah and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign uh in ohio i think it easier to do that because there is a law that i don think it in primaries but in general elections at eleven clock in the morning and four clock in the afternoon they hafta list those who have voted they hafta put up a list of uh registered voters and cross out those who have voted so what i useta do is i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support or wer was undecided on the election and i would cross off those that had voted and then i had a list of those that hadn and i had people waiting at a phone bank and i call them at work or at home and and i offer to take them to the polls if you don have a ride uh we will take you to the polls if you re worried about yknow someone watching your kids we have certified teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babysit for you while you go to vote because i ve also read studies that say people who are routed from their home or their office yknow and are reminded to go vote will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that because what i did was is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say hi this is roberta i calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote and oh by the way oh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levy and and if you need a ride let me know we ve got them set up for you and but yknow that very i mean eh and and that not getting people to vote and encourage them to vote because they should that a a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate i don know how you get people to vote i don know why they don think it important maybe because we ve had it too easy my go godfather my grandfather didn my grandfather didn i mean there was a king and queen and yknow he had no right to vote so that when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the world to him yknow and that that he just passed it on to yknow his daughter my mother my father i don know how he it was important to him but it was always important to him and we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes we talked about issues and he said yknow it was important to to be heard so i don know if it was that it got passed on parent wise or what it was um hum there no issue um hum right not specifically no uh sometimes um little groups of sometimes you wou i if there was a college in a community when i was running a school levy campaign um we would try to get them either registered and and active in a campaign um but it was very difficult i it it sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park active in voting yknow there are certain little blocks of people uh and on school levies the people who voted no which were senior citizens i mean they they went to the polls in droves you didn hafta yknow the the the the hope there was that they wouldn go to vote on the school levy uh but actually trying to get college kids involved i haven really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big um hum if if you didn own let say on a school levy and you didn uh you you pay taxes i always get because i rent and i always get very upset and i very angry when people say well you don hafta pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it built into the rent uh at least it it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord uh and i don i ve never lived any place where my rent didn go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond just yknow uh of what the levy was uh so that would be the first thing i say and then i also say that yknow uh because uh a a a number of reasons that people don vote for school levies now is because they don have kids in the schools yknow but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you don have an educated citizenry uh your voters democracy could go down the drain um that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or yknow the the university of virginia and believed in education yknow because he said without an educated citizenry you won understand the issues yknow but it very difficult today to get to people um i ve talked to some i ve almost college age students and they don see the relationship you can talk logic to them all you want and it not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it doesn mean anything to them and i don know why i wish i did but i don know why i think the latter i don think it ll make any difference the kids that i know in uh junior high and in in yknow college uh it just doesn make any difference to them and they don like those classes they think they re boring they think it has no relevance to their life yeah it it might and yknow good teachers do that i i us used i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity based teaching um and i was doing some volunteer work at dublin schools it was supposed be one of the better schools in the area and i thought there be all sorts of creative things going on and there wasn it was still read the chapter write the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things um i not sure there so much influence from the media uh and i say media broad based so you be it print media or tv um that has this culture today of um stars and yknow media of of phenomenons and and they don see the relevance and i don think they hear from their parents like i did the importance of voting and that where it comes from their parents don vote so if their parents don vote they aren uh again i don know what the the answer is um but it very scary what gonna happen in the next couple of generations the only good thought for me is i think about this is that i won be here to see the disintegration of the democracy although i have great faith too i have great faith in democracy um there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if there were an issue i think kids would ge if if there were kids in college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people didn think was important or had no real relevance to their lives i mean i think the kids would would rally immediately and th the issue right now is that there nothing there right the ri um hum it it might uh it might um i was gonna say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campaigns i ve seen in recent years utilizing college age students has been clinton campaign both times uh he knew he needed to get a base to increase um his chances of winning the election and did especially in the first campaign in and and i believe that was ninety two did a really super job of organizing college students because that when you re at your most um well when you believe in things and you re at your most idealistic and you would think that yknow kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that um in addition to that and as an under current it wasn overt in the clinton campaign but i know when i talked to people uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion is an a very divisive issue in this country and i think it it does mobilize people but it also divides them yknow definitively almost like in vietnam almost like that war divided people um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting roe versus wade and not and in protecting choice yknow i um and i i starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign there i ve seen a couple of editorials in the paper about yknow the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three supreme court justices and at that if you want to protect that right you ve gotta vote with the candidate who gonna put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way both in ninety two and again in four years la in ninety six uh and i think that gonna happen again uh because the the candidates and i telling you my politics here very and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice uh and um uh i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i don think it an issue that if you did overtly and said yknow support candidate a over candidate because they ll protect abortion rights that gonna divide the country and not keep us together um hum right um hum and that essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was right or wrong it been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people yknow which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but yknow it too late right um hum um hum which meant she never get the nomination because of who controls the republican party you uh just how like too how there no real like everybody conforms to their own set of norms in each group yknow it like people no matter like yknow even if ted kaczynski is out like uh on yknow wherever in like his little shed yknow he still a part of society like how you can get from society and just how like how society develops in general like how high school like is is kind of true to life but then really different too on how life is but just how it just a a more of a like more of a closeknit thing so it more apparent how how segregation works or whatever yeah yeah people that just uh really wanna teach as opposed to like i don know why other people wanna like even went into teaching at all yknow but um i think that would help just making it more like not so impersonal not so this is yknow you do this to get this certain grade it like you do this to learn this because it interesting as opposed to like and i don know i think it like there a lot of things that it more like compulsory education is weird like being forced to take this class like i think that if i uh but i mean it good to being forced to take a bro like a liberal arts thing because like you don know what you wa wanna do so it like if like you hate math and you don take it at all but then you decide you wanna do something in math then you re like screwed like can go back see i hate that like all the work that you do is like reduced to like one letter and it li i like how see like i thought about going to antioch but it was it was really expensive and like um i don know but just because the and the school more of a nontraditional ty type where they give you like evaluations and you don get grades like and so so then it that what that what i heard it like at antioch where the professor writes uh like a couple page paper on your like performance on the quarter and that that really shows that i mean that a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he really involved in noticing what you re doing as opposed to just like some kid in his class you yeah like i not i not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i don know i think it like a lot of times they re really desperate to find and so they really just take whoever i mean they re lucky enough to even have a body to fill the place and they re doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean sort of i mean eh i mean i it working well enough i guess i mean like people are learning things and like wanting to go on to college and stuff um i don know uh maybe i i think maybe if teachers just their status in society isn real high when it should be um it more like i yknow i ve heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers yknow and how but it um so it just like people always talk about yknow education for the ch yknow we gotta like think about our child future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap like don really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get get like more of a respect but like it just like teat like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in in your life like in chr like especially in adolescence too like really influence like how you are as a person and like people don like take that for granted a lot like if you have bad teachers in one subject you re gonna hate that subject yknow and like if you have good teachers you re gonna love it i mean that really in influences too like how like what you wanna do with your life yknow and people don really acknowledge that too much sometimes i think that it just like math sucks and it like that a like there no there not a lot you really you can really do with that yeah okay yeah sure no it okay you know what i mean can do this you can do that yeah yeah but i mean yknow a that you know might wanna save up for something when he twelve years old has no chance at all getting a job yeah well we did that too i got one sister yeah yeah she lives over by uh riverside hospital about once a week my wife sees her usually more than me no my mom uh she not an invalid uh she seventy two years old but they go out usually to yard sales stuff like that stuff i don wanna do no offense yeah well put this way when i was a kid you didn wanna be brought home by the police you were actually scared of police nowadays wh what kids scared of nothing ain a damn thing they re scared of whenever we were kids we used to make zip guns we take an ink pen take the pen piece out put a firecracker in put so it fizzed and yknow you pack it full and you had a gun you know that the stuff like that always been around but it seems now that the guns are more you can get them easier it like me i could be carrying a gun right now what are they gonna do to me they ain gonna lock me up carrying a concealed weapon they re gonna slap me on the arm now if i shoot you they might do sahm i mean don get me wrong i ain but i mean if i shoot you they might do something but otherwise than that they ain gonna do nothing depends upon how i store it now when i was a kid raised up we had gun locks on our guns even though i could pick them i mean it gun locks are easy to pick you can break into anything uh but when i was a kid too we used go out turkey shoots and i go hunting all the time so i was pretty familiar with guns my kid uh he grew up he was familiar with guns he also knew not to touch them if you know what i mean but i had no pistols at my house i had shotguns and rifles now to me a lot of these pistols like a twenty five caliber come on there is no use for gun like that thirty eight derringer yknow the only time the use for guns like that is to carry to shoot somebody when i worked yeah when when i worked at bars i carried a gun constantly and most the cops in neighborhood knew i carried a gun but they didn say nothing to me because they knew the reason why it because i carried the bar receipts now i could see to carrying one to that degree but there re you know there a limit you got all these people carrying guns because they ll tell you well it the neighborhood i live in or you have women carrying guns even down here on campus because they walk late at night uh it just there we go again who right who wrong i have no idea and you even got these the uh what stunt guns they re the ones that scare me what them little electric shock things i got a bad heart i don know what that do to me yeah but guns are always gonna be around ain gonna get rid of them but why would you make stricter gun laws when you can even enforce your traffic laws yknow so basically well yeah it might work but to me it kinda stupid yknow because what you re saying is we re gonna take this law and gonna stick you on this law but the hell with all the other laws so is that really fair i i ve almost been hit i don know how many times people talking on telephones i see people turning with no turn signals yknow just turn right out front of you everybody running red lights nowadays mean which laws you gonna pick out to enforce and which laws ain you uh to me if you gonna enforce the gun laws and make them stricter what you ought to do is put a limit on the barrel length and stuff on guns you get caught with a gun with a sg barrel smaller than uh eight inches you go to jail no ands ifs or buts you go to jail for three years if you got an eight inch barrel on your gun now you tell me where are you gonna put it you isn gonna get a lot of dates but you understand what i saying it you gonna have to make make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal yeah well you can carry a weapon here in columbus i can carry a weapon right now as long as out the open course i gonna get stopped for suspicious person everywhere i go but yknow it still the it constitution and stuff like that yknow they always bring it back our forefathers did this and our forefathers did that well our forefathers also were squatters does that mean i can move into this room and tell you it mine now come on yknow people i don know i hate to be in a predicament of having to change anything because be hard to change for one group and not another you know so i don know where to go to me the biggest thing would be if they got rid of these saturday night special guns and stuff like that yeah you re still yih you yeah you always still gonna have violence like we were kids like me and you would meet we get in a fight and after that we be best friends now now i be walking down the street hell fourteen year olds scare me to death right now not knowing they re gonna whip out a gun or not he ain gonna go to jail and then they re gonna say they wanna nail their parents yknow their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what their kid doing the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so you know what i mean basically all that all i ve ever seen is well like these kids that get in the house they go to the house they find a gun and they wanna hold the parents responsible yes and no on that if the parents had the gun in the house they had the ammunition locked up say in the trunk of their car what if the kid bought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the gun so basically there no way you know unless you have a steel cabinet to put that gun in and there we go rich can afford that but the poor can and most your people that own guns that are killing people are usually your poorer people most the i have uh i got one neighbor that hates me and he a sheriff and otherwise no i don have hardly any trouble with the kids i have more trouble with the parents yknow i don no i don fear none of the kids yes to some degree they should but there we go again that just like the people when i worked in bars they always want to hold the responsible but say you could come up i give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else but even though you re not responsible i the one supposed be responsible people yknow that have the beer party in the house yeah they should be held responsible to some degree but we re in a society that loves to sue people yknow how far are they held responsible i don know you have to go on a case by case basis on that well when when i was growing up there wasn as that much violence and i could go in indiana and i have done it now my name ain on this report so you can do nothing about i picked eighty pounds of pot one time growing along the railroad tracks and brought it back to columbus eighty pounds it used to grow wild when i was kid you could find it all over the place and you didn the violence and stuff like that i have never and yknow i just using pot right now i ve never heard anybody going on a shooting rampage that were high on pot most of them are sitting home waiting on a pizza huh and it just like cocaine and stuff like that you know your laws are different crack cocaine is one powder cocaine is another you know and what they re saying on that is that a prejudice thing is what they are saying because they are saying more blacks do crack cocaine than powder cocaine prison thing i sure you heard about that but the same principle applies but i talking about just every day things uh that uh people who if you wanna talk atop children primarily uh there is no penalty any more uh parents are scared to death uh to pick up one up and spank them um with their bare hands or or to make them stand in a corner because they considered and i going back to the word harassment child abuse and harassment of consequence um and a uh and penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply look at janie and say janie you should not do that and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack oh on the bottom oh with the bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know that my the most effective penalty for me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and yeah it left marks but and sure it hurt i mean it would sting and i understood exactly what was meant and i think i grew up and i ve ended up being i think a quite successful person i think my mother had uh uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty doggone decent kids and none of us were injured none of us were hurt uh and that was a basic method of penalty ih it wasn something that truly hur injured uh now today however uh i suspect my mom could easily be ha could have been charged with abuse in fact child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where that uh green swi it always a green switch because uh uh the old ones they would break you didn want them break yeah there was just something about that sting far better far more than a paddle paddle was kind of a whop and then was end up with a sting and it kind of got your attention and then you remem appeals appeals mm hmm i read and um hum there was an in depth story about that i think it was i don was harper magazine or what it was in a uh uh say significant magazine where they had uh made a study of the new york situation and the i found that quite interesting and very very impressive uh as a matter of fact whatever it was i remember sending it in to the uh city council uh oh of dayton i just addressed the um hum i just had a uh healthy vigorous conversation last night with a township trustee jersey township which is just over in uh licking county and uh this gentleman is three or four years of age and he been the township trustee various times throughout his life and he is very very concerned because of the exploding back up he a farmer has been a farmer all of his life he owns about a hundred and fifty acres adjacent to approximately a thousand which his son is perdo mainly operating yet he goes out and works too uh helps out at eight eight ty at this age uh but he is concerned because they ve just recently passed an ordinance within the county which allows developers to come in and already they are ready to take over a couple farms that are fairly close to him but i but it affects the whole township and one of the things that they left out as he put it one of the ordinances that he hh pushed and pushed and pushed he wanted a specific part of that ordinance to say every so many people that move in to this area you must provide for a school and he said of consequen and then he said they didn do it and he said i push and push and he said i didn know all the influence was on on the side to get more houses get more houses because it was gonna produce more taxes but he kept saying well what do you want these taxes for if you re not gonna provide for schools so he was very concerned about that so here was a case in my th thinking opinion a very very honest uh politician but he was also being away what he felt was an honest approach uh huh let me focus on wh what you re question i not that i that she was answering what i thought but um okay all right well i was born in columbus i am twenty seven graduated from ohio state uh in psychology so i should i should really realize this parking situation but like i said i usually walk and and today i don really feel like it um i i having a baby in about two weeks here really ready to get this over um i three brothers and sisters my parents are divorced and i lived with my mom and those the three over there and then my dad family th i have a brother and a sister over there uh which is nice i ve got a lot of support from everybody get gets good kind of confusing on holidays yeah for everybody so it kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest from from their families too so it the first great grandchild and and with my husband he is it hi he the oldest so for everybody it crazy because everybody wants to buy us everything yknow and i going oh my gosh and they re like just give me a list and somebody is like i wanna get this and i wanna get that so it just it just been it something else which is which is good though because our families are pretty similar and they re all real positive about it but basically i i lived here for for my whole life and i grew up on campus and and um and then i my family moved to clintonville we kind of lived up there a while yeah yeah i lived on summit street so we when i was younger we used my dad and i would ride our bikes down here and it was just kind of always said i gonna go to the university of hawaii but that never happe i kind of stayed here so um hum hmm how you end up in ohio really huh really time to go all right i done uh huh okay wow i getting i getting it it been i it been a remarkably well i mean i haven had any problems i found out pretty early which was kind of strange in about four weeks and i went in and uh i had a check up and my doctor he thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an ultrasound well the thing is they did this ultrasound they didn find anything so which was really kinda creepy because they didn know because there that whole tubule pregnancy thing and all this stuff and and the guy that did my ultrasound wasn my regular doctor and he kind of little he he he just a little abrupt for me and he says well yknow if this is what it is yknow you could have a lot of serious problems you could and all this stuff and i said wait a minute i not ready for this but after after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that it gone really well i mean i just i and i know we just finished our lamaze classes last night and there were some women in there they re huge i mean these girls can even get off the floor and i just feel really bad for them for me it it gone very very well i mean i haven really had any problems well a little bit near the beginning and that was pretty miserable but it been it been a while from so it that not something that that right now i ve had any anything like that so um hum um hum really really um hum oh really back to bed rest right wow huh yeah i ve got i ve gottenen plenty of peopuh it funny jason mom asks me so is your mom gonna come and stay with you for a i said no i told my mom she started laughing because i mean of course for her to come over and help out is terrific but if she actually stayed at my house for a week i think we just kill each um about fifteen my mom and i don go to far from each other but jason gonna take the week off and everything so i think that we ll we ll be able to do that yeah well we didn we didn find out we had a i don know we figured we just wait and be surprised is that what you guys did yeah we had a my mom has a friend that does ultrasounds at um i think it was mount carmel we went over the weekend and we went there saturday morning and i ve got this forty five minute ultrasound tape of the baby which is cute because you can only see parts of it but you can really you can see its face you can see what it looks like and everything but i said i don wanna know the sex and it so hard to because we re looking of course we re going through this tape trying to see if we can see anything and you just kae can you just can tell i think she was real careful to make sure that that we wouldn be able to she says i know what it is but i said um alright well just don tell us so so that was kinda neat then we ve got girls names so we ve got either sydney or mackenzie for a girl and then well thank i li yeah i think think that we both this think to collectively together i know jason likes sydney a little bit better but um i don know about boys names and i just well he said one like when i was about three months that we both really liked but that wasn really names weren really what we were thinking about then neither one of us can remember it so i don um hum right aw uh huh uh huh i figure when the time comes we ll just have to figure it yeah aw that nice oh my goodness oh she a cute she really is really cute i mean i mean she got big eyes and big fluffy cheeks she is she adorable how is she in this picture really goodness can get away from her can oh aren you holding it oh the you lost your hm yeah i was because where i was i was working at a grecruiting firm and we were doing we had a lot of business before and um and i was pretty sick during during the morning and afternoon part and basically yknow we talked about it and just decided to go ahead and just take some time off i don know i also went back to school then too so i figured i take that time off and i i going to otterbein to get my masters in education so we re kinda doing that and then i figure i probably gonna wait tables at night and and finish going to school during the day so i got a job at hyde park so that ll i mean it just amazing because the money so good yknow you really can beat it i only have to work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and whatever um hyde park grill it uh it a restaurant it up in dublin so i don know i mean i did that all through high school and college and after i actually after i graduated from high school i managed a restaurant for about a year and a half so i mean it something i i comfortable with the hours with because jason works during the day too so it will probably work out pretty well for us just wanna get yeah i figuring i middle of january is my guess i ll go uh school starts i think the fifth of january and then i gonna go that i don know well i thi it weird because i had a job since i was fourteen and this is the first time in my whole life that i haven been working and it just like my mom and i go out to lunch and we go to breakfast what you do today well let see i went to breakfast with my mom and then amy and i went to lunch and then we yknow and we actually i we moved about three months ago so i ve been kinda doing a lot of stuff at our place so that nice i mean had a lot of time to get everything wallpapered and painted and just do all those kinds of things but it weird yknow because i don have to get up in the morning and i feel guilty yknow he leaves at six thirty or seven and i going bye have a nice day yknow and i still sleeping which is right now is really good because i have a hard time sleeping at night and after he leaves it wonderful because i can sleep in till about ten thirty and i feel a lot better yeah well i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it nothing worked i hoping that ll be the same experience as it is at ohio state snobs i from palo alta don talk to me yknow you re not you re not you re not worthy prob probably that all right okay som oh is that right so i not gonna get too much of an attitude from people okay i thinking who who back are pretty cool yknow is that right especially if they re a americans you have ah yknow like yknow th the th th th uh typical american tourist really they they are the biggest assholes the ma they are th they are th the they are the the majority huh oh boy that that like kinda like speaks poorly about us huh um hum yeah like you share your stuff food yknow or you share you share yknow you got the yknow like an extra blanket i would think yknow hey yknow you need some you need this or that oh is that right they re not just in yknow seeing seeing the sights or seeing the well maybe they are but it like that that a as a as a as a yknow as a secondary agenda their their main purpose is is that yknow drink around the world oh boy well see that because i don think americans travel as much as as like the the europeans do i think i guess because they have like i guess public transportation accessible they got the trains that the eurotrains and the buses and and and and just like the pers by just by personal car you can go yknow across just go across the border you can then go and visit uh yknow countries like like it so condensed but here it like we ve got our oceans and it like we gotta like fly so so i i think that why like i think the europeans are more are much more cooler in that respect rather than much more cosmopolitan just because it they they they it like it no big deal for for like somebody in europe to speak like seven languages where here it like yknow you get somebody over here who who can actually who actually knows english yknow it like so that that i think that i think that what i ll find hopefully hopefully you can you can isolate yourself from them uh it like americans americans don have a have a have a stronghold on it because i heard like i had never been here there i heard like new york don even don even ask a stranger because they won even talk to you they won look at you like on new york city it like they they will okay oh have you ever been there oh you have it like it like man i well after i heard that i said ma man that not even worth going if if they re gonna be rude do you really but it a lot would you say it a uh say it a nice place to visit but you wouldn wanna live there or would you actually live there really what did you do just like do the tourist thing like visit all those have you really have you gone to seen all the shows and no are they really wow i thought i thought they give you like at least student rates yknow graduate student rates whatever yknow like the wexner center but to go see something like cats or rent they still charge you out the really okay i didn realize that really yknow what half of a million dollars that still out of out of our out of our range oh my gosh the they don have any of these like mat student matinee specials where you can go in for like a buck fifty huh oh wow that makes it hard like if you got like a if like you and you got a family yknow yknow you take you if you you wanted to like spend the night on the town with your yknow with your family man that that kinda like blows your whole budget for the year wow wow so is you pretty much have to be yknow can be middle class in new york have to have to be rich or you re not um hum uh huh like not go out you re pretty your is your entertainment for the year like li like what the es you if you had time but if you had time and money and well you you be able to yknow do the do the tourists things oh they do like what then you could go visit what the empire is that the big thing like the statue of liberty do you really somebody said you could like walk up there like some sorta staircase and you can actually walk up to head if you really if you really wanted to go up and walk up through through her head you can do that is that right that it i think i remember like if they were like remodeling a few years back is that right okay yeah i go to class okay i i guess i better um to move forward in my life now what happened with the chill was yknow there was uh i had a friend that worked for them so they didn know that and um uh he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to install were supposed to have installed that was five feet higher three to five feet higher and um should have would have could have yknow if it was up i wouldn have got hit i mean there no two ways about it but if i didn get hit i wouldn be where i am now spiritually so i don refute it as an accident and most of the spiritual leaders and people i talked to ah went through the catholic church because that was where i was raised and what i was raised and none of those people could provide me with any adequate things terms of counseling i know they tried i know they did the best that they could but um there a lot of things that the catholic church won like to admit that they re wrong on and they are wrong um uh they ll sit there and ask me to atone for my sins yet they won atone for the sins of all the priests that are molesting children still to this day and they protect them and that not right and i very very uh outspoken about that so rather than banging my head on the wall to people who wouldn listen i just decided to leave the church i don go there anymore the only time i ve gone there was for my nephew baptism and my grandparents funeral and that the only time you ll find me in there yknow i went to a wedding too but it difficult sitting in there because of the way i follow now and uh and actually seeing things for what they are and it frustrating not being able to explain that to people but that okay um with the lawsuit ah we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they had all that higher taller glass back there over a year so they tried to use the excuse their excuse was that they couldn find the hardware to install it and uh given all the hardware stores that we have here and the ability to over night freight things uh if it was any kind of ah special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country there no excuse so basically yknow it came down to after it came to a legal battle which was ah i was not gonna back down they were um i was poor monetarily and they knew that so they were using the legal system to wear me down um the first uh at the date of filing i mean first of all it took i had a statute of limitations was two years uh i had an attorney in a law firm representing but they were dragging their feet i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill yknow and that they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet even though i knew the guy so i just said well look i dissatisfied i gonna go find another attorney so give me my file see you and i went shopping around for a new attorney and it took me about seven before pardon me seven attorneys before i found one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a neurosurgeon and uh he had experience and expertise in uh bringing up the uh the differences uh and the realities of of a brain injury ah and the effects the lifelong effects yknow so after the two years we got in uh just under the two years so i mean hell that would be what it happened in ninety three so just under december ninety five uh the day the last day of ah the statute running out we filed so we got it filed once it was filed the judge ah scheduled a hearing and for whatever stupid reason um the soonest they could hear the case was one year from the date that we filed so you can see when you get bed with yknow and involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multimillion dollar lawsuit or whatever yknow any kind of lawsuit uh the big boys get all the breaks so ah in my opinion the judge didn wanna hear the case before then or maybe his docket was full but i saying yknow there no prioritization in the legal system there are some things that uh should be addressed soon uh i shouldn have to wait that long but so then came down to one week prior to the uh hearing and i got a letter from my attorney and he said that uh and also a phone call from the office saying that uh um that they uh were filing a continuance which meant that uh the judge granted them an additional year of discovery um whatever the law says yknow the judge says he has to back it up but so that postponed the trial for another year which pissed me off yknow but that exactly what they were planning on yknow wearing me like i said knowing that i don have the money to throw in there and say hey yknow um but know full well that we had all the evidence that we had too so ah that just postponed it for another year finally we got into uh coming in and then they ah sent a letter saying they wanted to meet uh for arbitration to see if they we could hammer out some kind of settlement couple months before the trial uh i was unaware of this common practice but yknow it was very iffy situation um juries here uh in columbus have been mm ultra conservative uh they feel that people for some reason or another that people that have been legitimately injured and their lives have been affected that they don deserve money for whatever reason um and it and don think it fair that they can sit back and be that conservative if it hasn happened to them i don think that fair um because it does affect your entire lay has otherwise i be full time employed i be gainfully employed making money and i not and that that not because of anything uh it by choices on my part but it it uh you know there a lot that there a lot there the betrayal that i ve had to struggle with there a lot there that um yknow i felt i ve been betrayed by everybody that taught me i feel betrayed by the the government by the legal system by the politicians by all the people that have been put in charge to protect people to protect ideals to protect principles throw it out the window for money and then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt um it got down to just ah dollars and cents bartering for what my life was worth and it the bidding started at a hundred twenty five thousand dollars i feel i worth more than that yknow i feel like you can put a value on a human life um yknow there were just subtle things that yknow my sense of smell taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half ah just all the trauma that goes involved with it not just not just the physical trauma i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength uh i wasn killed yknow um so the physical burden i was still dealing with a lot of the physical pain uh it gotten significantly less but uh the emotional pain was worse and is worse um having to have a yknow a lack of money now means lack of socializing means lack of going and doing things um yknow don have any lot of relationships don have a girlfriend don have a wife don nothing like that i ve got a dog a golden retriever one two three four what kind mm hmm i ve been here all my life um i uh right now i don mm do anything uh i had a head injury in ninety three where i got hit with a hockey puck in the head at a chill hockey game and uh that when i lost my job after that and things got difficult more and more difficult um was unable to work full time i doing some part time work right now working with people with mental illness um but it yknow the the thing i running into out there is that uh nobody wants to pay you to do anything uh i don understand that but uh and then the when they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out of you yknow they give you a pager a cell phone and they want to know where you are morning noon and night seven days a week and that none of their business um so i the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate employer that understands my situation and and how i operate and will give me freedom to do what i can do i have a bachelor of arts in communications but it been more of a problem than it been a asset um interviewing for jobs people that uh were doing the interviewing had just a high school education and uh they re not gonna hire me when after a year i be their boss um so a lot of that is out there uh regardless of what people say i not trying to be pessimistic or negative it just been my experience uh unfortunately um i hope it gets better but uh like i said i haven been ever uh told that my degree matters by any employer uh contrary to what the news tells you and what people will tell you oh go get that college degree uh yknow uh people told me soon as i got out of college then i needed a masters and then they said and after you get your masters you ll definitely need your doctorate well yknow the people saying this are college people the college is a business uh and it takes awhile to realize if you can get in and get that education on grant money and scholarships that that good but then even now being a person with a somewhat disability from a brain injury um i mean i don even like to call it disability and i have uh different abilities now yknow same abilities i used to do but i have to do them a different way um just because my brain functions on a different level and i can explain that to anybody and i shouldn have to but i always forced to um but uh trying to find a job yknow uh resulting from this has been difficult and uh a and that uh yknow i not giving up hope or nothing like that i just trying to trying to cut through and see what i can do and uh yknow there just ah um um it very limited out there yknow an and your is is an asset but like i said even as a person uh now going through um i discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelors in other words uh bureau of vocational rehabilitation which is government funded organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work and um because i already have a bachelors they won pay for school now if i were stupid yknow if i just had a basic just got out of grade school and didn even have my boy they pay for my high school my college and everything yknow even living expenses yknow but because i have a bachelors nothing yknow her limited very limited so i mean it that what i saying the uh i think it even american disabilities act talks about certain things about employers um and and with my lawsuit yknow with the uh the chill and yknow with all the public trials of high profile trials i think it a education for everyone to know that the legal system sucks and does not work um is not fair it a rich man person or a rich person system judges are bought and paid for they re elected um there a lot of crap there and ine learned all this not from just my experience but from people that i know that are attorneys that there are judges down there that take bribes and that that not right so you can when you re dealing with that system justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident yknow laws are made to protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes and it not right it not fair but that the way it is so um i didn wanna go into law didn wanna go into paralegal i was looking into that and lady kept hounding me and telling me yknow well maybe you could get in it to make a difference i like why would i wanna make a difference if it kills me yknow because i know myself and i don put up with crap yknow i see a liar i bring him out yknow and uh i was just brought up to be an honest person and um unfortunately there a lot of people out there that yknow they sell out their ideals and their principles for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially excuse to sell those ideals out i not that kind of person and i won ever be um so if that means that i stay monetarily poor for the rest of my life then so be it yknow i got a conscience and uh and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there but that yknow that basically where i ve been yknow um i ve lived here my whole life like i said i went to college i played baseball um due to injuries yknow knees and shoulder i just i was very i was pro caliber yknow uh i played baseball with the with paul neil and kent murker which are a couple of guys that yknow did get signed and are playing right now um so at least i can say i played against them and uh least with kent murker i can say i hit a home run off of him so that was a while ago but that was when he was young and very good i i was three or four years older and still took him deep to center field so i ll never forget that but uh i earned that so that um well um well that uh yknow i i don refer to it as an accident anymore yknow they re um my whole life it changed ah in every facet um from it um yknow physically emotionally mentally and spiritually um used to be catholic i don follow that way anymore and um yeah i follow more uh ah natural way of following god nothing uh new age i don wanna say exactly what yknow just say that the people this land long time ago before anybody came over here with their bibles and crap um ramming jesus down people throat the people of this land had a way of worshipping god and that the way i wanna that the way i follow um so a lot of people say that native or say that indian or whatever yknow i don care what they wanna put on it but it it that a natural way of following god it the way i put it yknow worshipping that there and respecting the spirit that moves through all things all living things and uh so i went through all that all those changes and uh are still yknow coping with them and trying to find ways to cope with them to the objectives in vietnam were never clearly delineated and they were in italy and europe and uh there wasn the definite enemy in vietnam that there was in europe i think that part of it and of course the attitude of most of the guys that went to vietnam was a little bit different from from where i was probably is a consequence of our understanding of the the uh objectives because uh when we went into the service and then went overseas our objective was to do away with hitler and mussolini and uh i don know they i just thankful that he he wasn in a carrying a rifle in a rifle company or something because that was rough he uh told he never said much about it except he told about one time when he was in the hospital up in japan after he was burned he said that he was in a ward with a bunch of other burn patients and and he said the some of them and him included were able to get up and walk around so the and i can see their philosophy the medics had the guys that could walk help wait on the guys that were bed bound and uh he was had been helping one guy that was pretty bad off and this guy passed away didn make it and so they started to put orrin get warren to do something else with some of the other guys i through i not working anymore with them he told them and they swore yes you are he said what are you gonna do send me back over to vietnam but they sent him home but he was he was uh not a very enthusiastic soldier i don think at any time and especially after he came home now what yeah well i don think that women should be on the front lines uh some women are phys are physically able to do what needed some definitely aren of course there a same by the same token some men aren but uh as a as support groups i think that all right huh yeah i never heard a thing about it all the time i was in the service and i don know whether orrin did or not he never said anything if he has but uh i think my attitude would be uh don tell and you know uh the the guys that co come out in a very vocishou vociferously in favor of uh publicizing it and all that i don see what they expect to gain i mean if they they uh in fact i don i don think that they do gain anything by it it wasn publicized to the degree that it is now it seems like anymore nothing is sacred i mean as far as papers are concerned and uh there something else that i i guess i old fashioned but i don think we need all this publicity about all the sexual escapades of all the people that are notari notarized or no have notarious lives uh i just uh i think maybe i old fashioned but i and they i can hardly conceive anyone being a genuine homosexual i mean evidently they are um but uh it so against human nature i think or against conventional human nature anyway well there been quite a change in attitude of the general public i thinik as far as wri women work women working away from home is concerned and uh i don know i glad that my wife was able to work there at home well actually she worked in an office when our first boy was just small but uh her mother stayed with us for several uh two or three years and she was a baby sitter for our oldest boy and uh she said well mary would just well go out and get a job she doesn need to be sit around here i mean that was uh and she was a mary mother was a kind of a free thinking uh uh not a liberal but uh well she went out when she was in her early twenties went out to north or uh north or south dakota one or the other and homesteaded on a homestead and uh then while she was out there she met a a cowboy who was from also from ohio and uh they uh they were married while they were out there i guess but uh she was uh my son used to say she was a piece of work she she hadn definite ideas about pretty near everything um yeah i just realized that like i don know it just different then i thought so if like i not happy in a place like i shouldn stay and just be miserable about it yeah i thought it was gonna be like not so structured but it really is and like especially i mean it i know it like all first year classes are basically the same and it just kind of like how i don know i thought it would be different like more of a like more of an adult type thing when really it just they treat you the exact same way like i don know yeah i think that true and like i lived in the dorms too and i really i really didn like that like it was like i don know it was like living in a hotel or something it was really weird and like like just like like communal showers and stuff and like um just how it like one room that you like kind of live in or whatever yknow it more like like the army or something yknow like real everything real simple and everything uniform and like i don know yeah um hum yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and then i just like ended up withdrawing because i would have like failed everything anyways but um yeah then i was living with my friend for awhile but and then like now me and her and my other friend live in down on maynard um hum yeah like i knew uh like a lot of people who live down on campus i used to live down on hudson like over the summer before i went to um so i mean i like campus and everything it just like is different than campus yeah no about about same age well my one friend went to school in philadelphia for a while but she didn she went to a like a university arts which is a like a theater school and uh it was real uh like intense or whatever yknow it like double the the workload of of a normal college so she didn like that so she came back and was kind of in the same situation that i was like not really knowing what to do or whatever and then my one friend who we re living with like he he he goes here he likes it i guess like i don know first year yeah second quarter um hum yeah yeah well like um i i knew one of my friends from sunbury was uh because kat does a lot of acting stuff and like um my one friend uh knew knew her like they did plays together like down at like columbus junior theater or something and like that so like um that how we got introduced or whatever and then just been friends for a while couple a couple years yeah yeah well like i mean high school high school always been really easy and like and like high school really easy like i never really felt like challenged even remotely by anything like and so like high school kind of like a joke and it was real fun and everything yknow just to like not really have to do pretty much of anything yknow and like um and like so college was a a little bit different i mean it was like a little bit more challenging i mean it basically the same thing in high school you just have less time to do the material yknow so it just like as opposed to having three weeks to doing a paper and doing it the night before you have three days to do it and you still do it the night before it just like i don know i thought i just kind of like found out like that i really don like school and like ever wanna go back and like having to take having to take math again like i just was like isn really my thing like when too like i always knew that this it would be like this you always have to take basic classes but like i was a history major and so it like i don care about math at all and like anything that i would do would be humanities or like so it like like yeah well like i i played music and stuff with a lot of my friends i don know basically just like standard teenage stuff sitting around watching tv and like i don know just running around or whatever but like um yeah high school was always just real like like yknow you put in like a tiny little bit of effort and you get like a and that a that good enough i guess yeah it like it okay i mean it like a country school which was always real weird too i was always like me and like my friends were always like the because i used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippie or whatever and like um that was i guess weird kind of like being the odd people in a in a small like in a small midwestern farming school it is kind of odd i guess um i don know um yeah yeah it was just like there was a lot of people there who yknow like their parents were farmers and or they they were whatever you know it was like like preppy kids or like hick type kids you know who yeah yeah i mean there was like a there was like a lot of kids who were who were different but just like not the majority or whatever like not really i mean i played we played with friends we never played anywhere just fooling around like in people basements and stuff like never really organized enough to try and play anywhere really guitar bass yeah like like real like yknow like jam oriented stuff yknow like the dead stuff like that like i don know like like like dead kind of like reggae type stuff too just like a bunch of different things yeah things that are like simple chord changes and you can just fool around with them and stuff not really um i more into like more beat beat oriented music like um since i like i go to like so called raves or whatever yeah like um i really like into that like just that type of music and um i don know uh i haven really played music in awhile because like um i starting to get back into it just doing different things uh like here i ve been yknow they ve been here for a while and then there wasn any parties here for a little while and then uh i been to ones in cleveland dayton uh akron detroit new york pittsburgh philadelphia it like it is um it like there flyers and stuff that you see or whatever and um you and and you get directions to it and it ll be in a yknow there a a bunch of different places it ll be in yknow like a sports arena or something or or it depends how big they are i mean there ones where there like two hundred people there ones where there like five there ones where there a thousand there ones where there are like three thousand and like there ones in canada i didn i didn go to one but some of my friends went to it where there like fifteen thousand people there or something like that like i don know how it is in canada i think yeah it a big arena like a civic center or something like that and i think that really weird but that like too big but um it kind of it it interesting here yknow you just go to like uh i mean sometimes they got warehouses or or um like auditoriums or stuff and it just like dance music and lights and stuff it real fun yeah because it all continuously mixed so it like it not it not real i like it how like the rave scene is kind of like faceless because it like it not more like rock star oriented and stuff it more it more just like kind of a serious type type thing but but but not so like glam and like fame oriented and stuff yeah it not like there is a face behind like the music but not so much too yknow it not like and we know that the result could be death then like and it and it an agressin an aggression thing one side will be the aggressor one would obviously because you can have two uh two aggressive things uh uh naturally one would be aggressive and then one would be aggressive in it response you can you know what i mean so in like a state of war it was like that so in that context i think but like in the same context i feel it be wrong for a soldier to kill a civilian because they didn um they didn decide to become a combatant so if you re an if you re a combatant and you make that decision or your drafted which that that is kind of like making the decision in the sense that you are part of that society that got you drafted so if you choose to be part of that society that i mean that a little shadier if but still if you re if you both make the the desire to do it then so like if i were drafted i think i would fight i sure i would fight for the country or you know but i don think i would go you know i just don feel the need to go on a rampage or well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you re guilty or innocent there to me there worth thi worse things i would think than than dying you know you like i know in israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin he got locked up and he not allowed to see uh because uh um under jewish law you can kill for that for for that so he he got locked up and he not allowed to see another human being like they have this they have like two doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and then he opens and like could you imagine like no sunlight you know the and i they don give him they keep it warm and he not allowed sheets or razors or you know other than electric razors so he can kill himself so you re just stuck there nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies and that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse just the agony and the and the i think you have to go insane like there only so much you i ask for board games or something but like he ca can doesn even hear a human voice because wah i think it something like that was written in the scriptures like you re dead to the world for uh i is the worse that you can do and so the world sees him you know what i mean so that be that be real rough and so obviously he would want to um i would like they say like now like people that observe him he like sings to himself and he reads the bible like everyday but like i don know that be be such a horrible thing to go through i couldn imagine being locked in a room for few days like that like solitary but like unlimited solitary that doesn seem right either but yeah like it just it killing it own citizens it so yeah yeah exactly if you just look at the nature of what they re doing it just inherently wrong to me yeah exactly that ll solve the that just it ridiculous you can get in huge arguments people like no you re lying because if your mother died or someone close to you died you would want them dead and honestly i can honestly say i would not want that to happen to them you know people can understa they can fathom that exactly they cannot understand where you re coming from yeah not not for special conditions just universally it wrong yeah that what it is it a marketing thing maybe at the under lying base exactly that ridiculous it like barbarism to me like ugh yeah and we re one of texas is supporting strong they have like i forget they have the like way more than like they dwarf any other state i think so that to me is not that not admirable and then i wou a so the that one reason i wouldn vote for bush plus i don really feel like the republican party the at a whole like at their political convention like in uh the last presidential election in ninety six they said one in ten of the delegates that were attending the convention were millionaires now granted i know more than ten people and not you know what i so to me just feel that not a good representation yeah yeah they they definitely struggle it they do some i i think to be that high up obviously you re gonna come in contact with powerful people people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind i don know i don think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than the so like i said best out of a bad bunch i probably yeah i so i think so and like they just don neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity me you know so i have no idea i remember where i was too when the columbine shooting because like my friends and i we re sitting around drinking a few and you know we re channel surfing and you know we see that kid fall out of the window and we re like oh my god what is going on so we just left it on and it was quite eyz like it was disturbing because i like i was recently out of high school myself and like sure there were fights and stuff but it was like you could avoid them or know what i mean but now it seems like people are just like i don know why that a trend i mean my dad said uh he grew up in the bronx and he said even in the when he was in high school that they had they had police officers there so that not like a new thing but he said you have people with like knives and you have people with fist fights but you like guns was unheard of you know and i think i don know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh they re people feel dejected in high school i sure of it you know like i don i was wasn i didn feel that way but i like in retrospect i look back and i thought you know i thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day was like traumatizing to them like that be so like for four years every day you re just like or something like horrible and you like no one talks to you i not justifying what they do at all but i saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason to say you know what i sick of this i gonna shoot those but i yeah i mean getting a gun doesn se i mean i was surprised like a i would i ve never owned a gun but i i think it pretty easy to get one yeah so yeah and a lot people turn eighteen when they re in high school so i sure they can go get one there that just ridiculous too but yeah that to me that really weird i don like i said i don know what they re thi th what they re thinking it or their thought process was but i thinking maybe it the social because a lot to me a high school is real social and like the social aspects of it were problem so like i know uh like i was a four year member of student council and like did that di went that route in high school and i know we always tried to involve other people but like they would look at us and be like that so lame i would never do it so like it like you had these warring like two different camps the you know the camp that gets enthusiastic and and that where i was and then there the other camp and i sure they have their own hierarchy their whole structure and like you know they do things their way while say while pooh poohing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff as far as bringing the two together like socially i think that just a rough age you know because yi you re learning more about yourself and uh you re al you re also learning more about like you re a lot of freedoms that you didn have obviously you know you re driving on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can really answer that question how they would have voted uh because i didn think that mike coleman exactly had charisma either his youth um hum right and uh and that really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in nineteen ninety two because i uh uh uh i haven said it yet but yknow anyone who listening to this tape or you would be able to know i a democrat and generally vote democratic although i ll tell you i i did vote for gre greg lashuka once and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style and he hasn been bad for the city but um i generally a democrat uh and i ve only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in ninety two early on that clinton was gonna win just by being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend and a waiter came up and um he said something about yknow and i can remember how we got started on the topic yknow just taking my my order for a restaurant but he said something about um uh dole was too old and this was a young guy he was in college and i knew there was there was a a a sort of a shift people wanted someone with younger ideas and um a new vision they didn want the world war two vision anymore uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really understand the difference in issues and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clinton so i think for the average voter that does have a a lot of sway i not sure yet um at least based on money raised it looks like george could trample almost anybody but george hasn gotten out there in the fray yet and given too many answers to issues he talks about compassionate conservativism and i don know what that means yknow i i want answers to specific questions as to what does compassionate conservative mean but i don think that i uh average in that i don go for the the the slick image bothers me um he has the potential of ch of trampling gore i think that gore will be the the nominee no matter what bradley does gore has it sewn up because he the insider um at yeah i thi uh i think they re both boring if you look at the the image thing they re both fairly wooden neither one of them seems comfortable in front of a camera uh it interesting on on bradley my boyfriend is is big in sports he he not as liberal as i am he a little bit on the conservative side um and he but he would support bradley simply because he was a a a former uh basketball player and i about ready to say to him at some point in time yknow if he becomes president he you re gonna hate him because he has all of these big government things and you re against big government um so i don think people always always see that but um between gore and bradley i don see much difference quite frankly bradley the more liberal um gore i think understands the need to compromise but i think gore will be the the candidate i don think bradley will be able to go past all of the work that gore been doing for eight years as vice president well see that not proved out by the the approval ratings he still has higher approval rating than reagan had in his last eighteen months so yknow people still like what he what he done i think that that um that yknow people don like all the crap that went with him as the pundints on tv yknow say that and they re they re still trying to get him i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done elizabeth dole they wouldn have been able to attack on the issues so they find other things to get get her on so they start bringing out all these women and all that stuff on and most people didn care about it they didn care about it before the election they didn care about it during his campaign they didn care about it during his presidency it republican right wing i don know what who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate yknow he may have been a yknow he may have yknow but she was twenty one it not like it was someone who couldn make up her own mind what she wanted to do yknow and he may have been stupid and a cad uh but i don wanna know about it on day one when it hit the the news i didn want to know about it and on the end when he was yknow not impeached i didn wanna know about it and in between i didn wanna know about it and they just kept angering me because there were other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst i ve ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the of of where america is on such issues as gun control and women rights and and things that are important to people yknow they they ve tried to make pseudo issues out of clinton and then they tried to make a pseudo issue out of yknow giving a tax cut people don want a tax cut when it going to affect their social security or affect yknow uh the the the deficit yknow to get a a four or five dollar a tax cut when they re giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i don care if i get five dollars that won even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good with it so um i don know um hum yknow even republicans are like that uh i have a friend in new jersey or two friends uh a married couple she a de a lifelong democrat he been a lifelong republican uh and there always interesting discussions when um when i go to visit and i went to visit them few weeks before clinton was formally impeached last year and i just decided i wasn gonna bring it up uh and i been there three four days and finally at breakfast one morning henry said well you haven talked about clinton and the impeachment yet and i said henry because he the republican i said i don even wanna go there let i said i don even think we we wanna get involved in that conversation he says well he says i can understand you saying that but i thought you yknow i wanna tell you where i am he said when this whole thing started i sat down and wrote every one of my um new jersey representatives all of my senators and all of the congress people in new jersey and told them that i will never ever in my life vote republican again because of the way this has has played out i mean and this was a republican a lifelong republican he says i will always now vote democrat because this was just so stupid and such a waste of my my time the country time the country money uh when there are better things to be dealing with and a lot of republicans felt that way you rad to be really extreme right wing to feel other than that except here in central ohio um hum right um hum right right doesn even right i know i wouldn i i there generally tends be at least one or two republicans i vote for each eat each election now sometimes i voted straight democrat because i yknow i even voted for dorothy teater the first time she ran for county commissioner uh because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and and i liked what she was saying but then her votes later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i didn i didn vote for her after that but the first time she ran for county commissioner i did it one because she was a woman and i like yknow i i when possible i like to vote for women yknow talk to her but people don when i was fourteen i didn care what anybody told me i was gonna do it no matter what i really didn because i felt like i was in love with these boys yeah yep yep to wear a condom i would mostly try to scare him like you these girls could give you things that make your thing fall off or yknow i would try to scare him yknow to make him know to wear a condom because you don know what he yknow putting himself into hum um right yeah yeah oh yeah yeah um hum yep yeah i do because some boys might not wear them because they don know how to put them on or i don know i not sure because i not a boy maybe some boys uh would experience with it before they originally use it yknow i not but i don think it it encouraging them at all at the same time they should be telling them they shouldn have sex till they re married yknow but no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too um i never i never did it and i yknow wish i could have waited till i was married but i yknow you re going through that whatever you go through when you re a teenager so you re like so what well most kids i not yknow some people st some kids still do that but i think i yes i do think they should put that in it also that well i should tell them that they should love themselves the wa the girls should wear both of them should love their bodies and not yknow give it to a boy that yknow falling all over you and you re you feel all good and this and that you should respect yourself and love your body yknow don let don give yourself to somebody just because you re feeling you re feeling good um and the boys i should the boys need to calm down um i don i i mean um hum yep but that what they go through and i i i would just tell the boys yknow respect these uh wo these girls because they re gonna be women and yknow try to wait yknow yknow if you love this girl if you think you love this girl wait till she go through high school together and stuff yknow it won work but i don i don think they should i don have any pro i don yknow if people are gay or yknow that their business but i don think they that not that not how this world was they wasn put yknow it was a man and a woman to start out with i don i don think um they should encourage that yknow maybe that a hard um topic to for me to talk about because i i don know because i sure there are gay boys i that are ad not knowing what going on with themselves that are in school and and i i ve never really understood i don i never really understood if they were born like that or i do don i ve just never really understood that to tell you truth so i wouldn yknow i would just i if i was a teacher i would just talk to talk to them and tell them dh to do whatever they feel i mean if they feel comfortable with being like that that fine but i don know i i don know if i would talk about the but maybe they should because there might be kids in school that are like that and they re like well what should i do yeah yep um yeah i mean i ve got girls that are that have girlfriends and stuff and it doesn bother me i i mean i not i like men and i i i a christian and i just believe that yknow you should be you shouldn god didn put two women on this earth god didn put two men they put a man and a woman to be together to have kids i would just tell him that is just a feeling he going through who he yknow i i ve went through that where yknow you you look at a woman and you re you she attractive to you yknow but that just something that going through your mind and that i think that like the devil getting into you because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do it even though i might be really would have been real drunk or yknow or i not drunk and just yknow i would just tell him that something he going through and that for him to do that that he yknow he a man and i would tell him god didn put two men on this earth and if he would cho choose to do that that i wouldn hate him or disown him or anything like that it all up to that human being if they want to change if they got their mind set on they don want to be the yknow other other sex i don think they can change them yknow that all up to that person i think yeah if they want if they yknow choose i i sure there yknow women that are lesbians that have been with men also yknow they ve been with a man and then they ve been with the woman now now they got a girlfriend so obviously yknow and i feel like that was because they ve they a had a attraction towards a woman so now they think they re lesbian i don see how i don that why i think so i don think that but if that their choice that their choice so i do think they could change nope huh um no they yeah well the grandmother she says she a christian but i don see it i mean a lot of people claim they re something and yknow which i might not be a total christian because i don do all the right things but i do believe in god i do believe i gonna go to heaven and i try not to yknow sin too much and i do pray to him and i yknow i just i don go to church like i i used to go to church all when i was growing up and now i yknow i feel like you don have to go to church to believe in god and all that yknow i talk to him i talk to my grandparents that are in heaven and stuff yknow that just what i was raised as and one two three four five one two three four okay um hum i originally from columbus i an event coordinator for which is excellent caterer in german village i forty three years old i ve just been married uh three years i have no children uh i ve lived in columbus most of my life although i have i went to school in atlanta and i also lived in orlando florida i used to have a uh interior plantscape business and that why i moved to florida for so i really interested in horticulture interior design botany but when i did move back from columbus i was amazed with all the just in a five year span how much had grown and i think it a really good city to live in i think it really progressed well and i enjoy living here uh six years ago um hum five years amazing how much the growth in delaware and different areas when i was growing up here and how marysville and it was such a farm town um just the growth of the different cities and suburbs of columbus is amazing and the housing and shopping you know but it just become a really good metropolitan city i mean it on it way um hum yep now with easton i think it really helped with columbus and yknow i think it just gonna get better and better yeah yes um hum columbus needs that as much people don want other things to close i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and yknow i don think that really fair to them hm oh yeah that beautiful yeah it nice they have a real nice arts festival every spring if you ever get a chance go down in march it right on their main street and nah they have gorgeous really neat unique things um hum it real well known i lived i went actually went there for interior design i lived right off street um right in there yeah and i had friends that lived in um buckhead where that nice mall is um some in smyrna which is outside ah atlanta but girls that i met through school and stuff um hum yeah um growing up my father had restaurants and a couple private clubs and so i was always interested in the food industry but more with planning of the parties deciding yknow what the client needs are and uh i really like working in that aspect with yknow nice and really creative and it nice because basically every job usually different um i doing a function tonight for three hundred people for the ohio republican party and yknow there just needs for each thing that i do which makes it interesting oh yeah um hum it the biggest thing yes um hum you know what um actually i don believe they have anything booked so far lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather than having people come in to their homes and things i ve usually i ve worked for different hotels where i ve always worked on new year eve and my husband this year is like yknow but we don even have any plans were gonna maybe do with friends and they re going to california so i not sure even exactly what i gonna do but right now there not an event scheduled which could change they are but the seems like they re going out yeah instead of having we don do things in hotels and things because they have in house yknow yes private homes and um actually where i worked there not a facility for parties so because it actually a market it all done outside like tonight we re going to the uh galberth pavilion which is um next to the ohio theater it really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there yeah yeah it is i like it i think yes especially season yep um we do office parties and yknow everything like yesterday we had to go to an attorneys firm and fruit and cookies and yknow i mean people tend to have food more and more you can believe gourmet lunches and yknow things lot more than they did let say ten years yeah um hum uh actually he um in the fifties he had a jazz club and um it was real popular it had food and live music um peggy lee sang and some kind of name people i wasn around but um and also he had a private club that um it was similar to the bunny club it was the key club where people had to pay a membership and it was in a real nice uh area downtown and he uh um he he a broker he liquor licenses and things so he owned several kinds of uh bars but originally he owned the um opened the topp steak house which is real popular in bexley um then sold it like three years later so mainly clubs and businesses but two really good restaurants yeah it is he is a commercial um heating and cooling technician he works for a major company out in indianapolis and he travels all over the state of he from ohio i met him um the year i moved back from florida and he had just moved back from dallas he had lived there for ten years uh we met i was working at a restaurant short north and they were having a christmas party and his brother worked there and he brought my husband and i went there and that how we met um hum yeah and i was thirty nine well you know what my parents never did because um they knew i was always level headed i always a lot of boyfriends yknow but i always i always felt like i was waiting for the right one and i had a few serious relationships but i just i never felt they were the right one and i did have a very serious relationship in florida uh he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i i love animals and things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so uh i was engaged to him but i decide to break it off because i didn think that was fair um i think anymore though with the women are more powerful and i think they they re finally making yknow good money and used to be women needed men to take care of them and they weren as much in the work force yknow i think things have changed really in the last years yknow in the eighties yes yknow there was definitely a point in my life where i was like oh am i ever gonna meet anybody and all my friends honestly most of them were all but um i enjoyed being single and i never really felt the the urge just to get married to get married and i i glad of that yeah yeah um hum um hum um hum um hum neither was i i really wasn and um it funny i just this summer went to my twenty fifth uh high school reunion and there were several couples who got married through the woman group and not really but i think living in the bible belt as she did she was living there ten years before she married and uh got involved in a youth group and i think that that was very influential on her decision and so she was married in the church all my other children were but yknow she she is going her own path and that fine with me she very good girl and she very conscientious and no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course and i would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as the rest of the children did but no i i very happy and content with he her decision yeah very much so in as a matter of fact ironically julie the tulsan she and her husband both baptists they have both their children in a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool and it a yes it it a catholic school environment so it ll be interesting to see what evolves from the children uh attention to the the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so oh i take the little ladies i take to church they re two elderly women that at the church ab it this has been about of seven or eight years ago father just mentioned that they had a need uh they had had a church bus and it had broken down so they had a need for to get people to church and i met these two elderly women now the one now is ninety she turned ninety last october and the other one is about seventy eight now and they live together and uh i take them to church on sunday take them to grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday but and i don do it as regularly now because of the advance in age yknow and that they re at the nazareth nazareth towers which is good because they they re they get better care there yeah they re dear well it not every sunday anymore uh but it was for a long time it was for a long time very slow very methodical we take them to dog doctor my husbands taken them many times for when they had to have cataract operations yknow so he involved with the girls too oh yeah that was a that was a job helping them to move janet lou helped she helped a lot um hum doesn bother me at all i see no i mean it it oh well i don believe that absolutely absolutely that was a lot of old thinking there is very definitely i think they ve tried to to uh bring the laymen in to more of the priest the duties of the priest but there like the consecration uh of the bread and wine that that none of that has been sanctioned they don perform they don uh uh um they re not able to give the sacramental graces for baptism confirmation holy com uh well they do holy communion but uh extreme unction matrimony none of those uh have been delegated outside of the duties of the priest but um i still think that it a good uh i do think the involvement of the laymen is very important but i don have any qua i i mean that doesn bother me a bit about women huh uh well and i don agree with that either um hum bar mitzvah i ve never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women aren priests is because they can don show any kind of uh spiritual leadership i i ve never heard that said and so there must be people who think that well when they had to cover their he heads i know all of that but i don think that really been um hum um i don think so well that true that right and they say not as many european men attend mass but in in at church yesterday i thought about that and i noticed how many men there are who do go to church in the united states um hum um hum um hum um hum i ve always thought that it it ends up being a personal decision well i lucky in that way because um i get travel a lot and it and so yknow if there something i really wanna see chicago not that far washington not that far um new york and yoh i don get to new york that often but um yknow i mean i can i still have access to a lot of stuff if i wanna go to the trouble i do i do um art fairs and i have yknow i ve got a couple in chicago and and i have couple in uh the washington area so oh lots of people travel all over i yknow i mean that i don lots people do yknow i mean they do shows on christmas if they had them but i yknow i i do ten twelve a year which is not real not a lot yeah yeah me yeah uh for me uh it it seems like um i have a mid western sort of humor which works best in the mid west i mean i have i have some east coast clientele and and uh bu and but like when i go to florida the people who who really like my work happen to be the people who are vacationing from columbus so no i ve never been to that one that one has a big rep that a a famous one oh yeah yeah oh yeah it huge well ynkow i i read a lot about about uh these particular britis british artists even before the show and before um the mayor had a cow so to speak but um uh so i yknow i mean it some of some of the pieces are interesting it it not exactly my style but frankly i yknow i just didn see anything to get that up about i mean i i saw uh uh the piece the piece that he specifically objected to and and read about it and so i mean i have to assume that it i mean it an election year and his yeah yeah yeah yeah i think it was just a political thing yeah yeah oh yeah yeah and i haven i haven heard the rest of the story but um what i ve heard of i mean in in court he wouldn have a chance a snowball chance of ever actually being able to to rescind the funding but still i mean it a it we don like to think about things happening a little bit yeah um that uh well i know about the gorilla masks and and and that uh yknow i word it a a women organization tha uh to promote women artists and and to um obje object to the to male hierarchy yknow th the that only only men get are in the museums and only men get the big gallery shows and stuff like that i don i don think so in new york it might be i mean like i say it a lot more competitive there here i think i think columbus is and the mid west in general i think is much more open to word yknow to art whatever it is wherever it comes from and there not the isn yknow there not the the old boy network yknow not as not as much who you know to get into things uh or th or that women are allowed to know the people that the boys know so it not it not as closed off that way um hum yeah ah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah it true i i i i had jansen and i i yknow that was course i was i went to art school so jansen was just in case you had to look something up it was there um our lecturers were all pretty pretty so that yknow we that the art history we got was was different than what would be what would just be in jansen so i never thought about that but um yeah lots of people who jansen is their only exposure would gee i wonder why women don do yeah but historically yknow women were no yknow it was a man field and and yknow even women who were doing it and doing it well didn get the attention didn get they didn make it into the history books yeah yeah yeah word but ya yknow i mean that would that that civilization i think so i think so if you re willing and yknow anybody who willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to yknow that you have to sell yourself there yknow you re not gonna just sit around and wait to be discovered but um if you put out the effort i really do don i don think there that kind of that kind of discrimination anymore badly i marketing is not my strong suit i mean most of the stuff that i get is just is a is an accident i started working for because another uh illustrator that they used who wasn gonna be able to do the work anymore recommended me yknow that kind of thing but he was a guy well there um i mean i pretty much you just keep making calls making appointments sending out slides um it helps if you can get a re yknow if you know an artist who in a gallery um i yknow if you can use them as a ref as a reference um but that it it mainly just sh you just have to uh knock on a lot of doors and be prepared for a lot of of no um hum um three years um hum because the problem with guns in my opinion is you don have to think to use it it takes yknow you don have to sit there and load it and in a split second i think we we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason yknow just stupidity or whatnot i don just in a split second yknow we we might have that once in a life where we can kill somebody that quickly and you can go oh yknow i didn mean to do that yeah well exactly i mean there are split seconds where you just wanna shoot somebody unfortunately anybody that says that i i mean i i don even like stepping on ants but there those moments where you re like yeah yeah and yeah so i no no yeah unfortunately well some people have to i mean yknow the police offers and what not they re required to carry a gun but um almost every kid i know that has has had a gu even if they keep a gun oh hidden here and the bullets hidden over here they find out a way to get to them and um i dated a guy where we came in on his little brother and he was loading the bullets in the gun and he had them totally separate like that and kids know and they re curious um i don know i i mean i not for guns because i ve i they the guns don scare me the people scare so no unless they have them in a safe or something th they and my i just that protection like they said normally you use it against somebody you didn mean to use it on and evf even if conflated somebody else comes into your house with a gun let face it are you gonna have the peace of mind to go get it i rather just have a bat by my door or something um so um hum um hum no thank goodness or if i did i blanked it out um hum yeah yeah right um hum um hum yeah um hum um hum well th theyorthe i yeah but let face it the people that have the real good guns are the people that shouldn have the meaning crime and whatnot um i don have a problem with people having guns but we don need sixty guns per person or whatever the ratio is it something ungodly like that and they keep making them and i mean yeah there was a time it was a part of our culture we did need to hunt to eat um i have friends that bow and arrow hunt i not real big into hunting but at least they re they have to do something besides sit there and um plus if they shoot somebody accidentally number one it really hard to and secondly it probably won kill them like a gun can um and you have to use your brain so i didn come from a hunting background um but my husband does work for the state highway patrol so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns but none of them hardly any of them hunt um and a lot of them they respect them if yknow what i mean they realize they can kill people we do get some of the yknow machismo people that just wanna go out and shoot things and yeah yeah i i yeah i don it not the guns that the problem it the people that are teaching um hum oh exactly i planning on just staying in the house if i can or whatnot ye oh yeah yeah i know i mean we re gonna get some water and whatnot because you don know people might turn things off like you said so yeah i think um as a whole we ve all kind of gone our separate ways which is scary mean we don have the same belief system in anything anymore so it kind of like oh geez definitely definitely um i haven personally researched it but i have seen um i would personally research it if i was president um documentaries and whatnot and things on twenty twenty which i don who whole heartedly believe just because it on tv and they say it so but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it on tv um that three strikes and you re out has really seemed to work in california because most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or what not um are doing most of the crime so once they re locked up yeah it costs more money to house them for life but they re saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets anymore so they don have to catch them they don have to process them etcetera um so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really is in wor the works and really working and we re really do we re gonna say we re doing instead of like little parents no honey don do that no honey don do that yknow what i mean because i think that part of our problem too um yeah exactly um i think that would deter people um you get one strike and you re like uh oh um maybe i better clean up my act my um hum um hum um hum um hum um hum sure no no but hopefully when they do get the one strike somebody i say somebody because i right now i don really think we have that in place but we would need more of a um one strike stepping stone yknow and i thi let face it counseling probably not gonna work uh and somebody in that it would almost take um i do personally know people that go into that type of environment here in columbus and actually work with the families and work with the kids and actually are in there living there showing them yknow it it one thing to go help them and then leave that and go home to your nice house i don unfor i admit it i couldn do it but um if people really did things like that i think there be help for them because they re actually friends or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i won be able to reach them probably just because what do i know about it word um i yeah i agree i don think it be a deterrent at all initially but if we had more things in place and somebody actually realized the background and tried to get them out of that hopefully even if you save half of them it better than than anything um hum um hum is that the way jesus christ would have brought that here well some people have their opinion and i said no no i say you you wear that collar you do something about that if you don then i realize what a spineless person you are but you ll never find me in your church again so i ve done what i ve done but there a lot of people out there that ll read a book on native american spirituality and they ll become self proclaimed spiritual leaders uh they ll learn the sweats there some people that have taken pictures of sweat lodges which you re not supposed to do uh they show step by step how to build one and tell word that some kind of wood to build it out of ninety percent of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood um there a way to do it and there a way to do it uh it has to be done that way traditionally there was a reason for that um because the people of this land were given specific instructions from their creator through visions through a woman called the bu white buffalo calf woman that came to the people and brought them these ceremonies like the sweat lodge they brought them the sacred pipe it not a it not a belief thing it a way of life and it a way of life that still in danger of being snuffed out but it won be it just it won be it just we gotta be careful about uh how and what you do and if you look native american spirituality or religion for lack of a better word ah because our people believe that religion you can uh you can encompass one word that is in the one word all of creation into religion all of what spirituality is into one word religion you can um but when you say it a of spiritual nature that yknow that still leaving the door wide open that it it broad it bigger than you or me ah but that ah that whole thing is um yknow the people of the land had a sp a specific instructions on how to do things and i i not saying they were perfect either there were a lot of indian people and there are a lot of indian people out there that are crooked as a dog hind leg that just the way it is they re corrupt the money has corrupt them the lack of money has corrupted them power has corrupted them um they wanna be a spiritual leader why i don know um to me it an ego thing and uh this rainbow eagle guy had some kind of buffalo uh um what do you call it a ceremony but he charged everybody native people don do that i mean traditional native people th you don charge people that wanna come learn about god there some people in california that say certain ceremonies were a native thing and they buried a woman in the ground with a straw told her it was some ritual of proving and over coming fear yet the lady was an asthmatic and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw in her mouth and she couldn breath and breathed in all the sand and died and so the first thing they put in the paper is that another native ceremony shows us how native american spirituality should be outlawed and if you look at any kind of uh spirituality religion that out there native americans are only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can have that there blood quantums saying that if you have a fourth or a half and even if you had two full bloods from two different tribes and they had a child the federal government still considers them a half blood why i don know doesn make sense but the federal government and their lawyers have done that and the department of the interior still considers native americans on the same level as a dog they don have something wrong there and that still goes on today after about six hundred years and we got good people in this country that wanna do something about it but unfortunately th what i finding you got everybody gotta choose their path there the ones that ll get out there with their picket signs and raise hell okay me i don wanna go to jail and get arrested because i feel i won do my people any service by being in jail but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that warriors that are out there men and women that ll do that uh more power to them uh all i can do is pray about it and that what i suggest to everybody else that the most powerful thing that you can do even one of the in high school that taught me had a poster on the wall that said things are wrought in this world by prayer then we ll ever know and that true um so that the most powerful thing i can do when i can turn it over to god and say god this is too damn big for me to handle you think you can work on maybe helping change this person heart or their mind because i can do that um so yknow i didn mean to get off on a tangent much much other things yknow that i coming to understand there uh yknow i just uh is i had three spiritual leaders tell me that a great gift came with that that there was it was no accident it was supposed to happen and uh there a word called synchronicity that um encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it chaos even though it seems like it an accident uh there a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they re supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that one of the things i also learned through this was that you don die you don physically maybe yknow there no denying that but spiritually not even physical death can break that it won and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul that very true yknow i could see in certain people when i was in the hospital the confusion unsure feelings yknow the uh i don know i didn there something that i could see there that i can explain and i still can explain it i just what i and then i go and try and tell the psychologist psychiatrist well they want to put me on some kind of anti hallucinogenic medication and i said well listen man yknow i not hallucinating and these people that hear voices they re not hallucinating they re hearing voices of spirits and in many cultures they ll tell you most the indigenous cultures throughout the world will tell you and the history will show that those people were revered as gifted this is the only society that labels them mentally ill and largely because of the fear of not knowing and not knowing how to deal with the unseen so yeah he did there no doubt in my mind that he heard those voices now whether they were actual audible voices or whether they were voices from the inside in his own mind regardless it part of that bad spirit that people have created not the devil not satan to the native people he doesn and to me he doesn exist he a piece of shit but he real and he real because people give him that they believe in him they empower that that of him empowers it his existence when you got like minded people around yknow you can create a spirit a bad one or a good one so this boy whatever he did um yeah there no doubt in my mind that he either heard internal voices or ah actual audible voices of spirits that were ah misguided spirits while they were here there are many people that were bad eggs man from high school and i one in that original group of kids that i had never did pass them all but i guess he not worried because he gonna work with his dad in his dad business so he gonna be okay but he never did pass the reading and the writing he passed everything else but and the questions aren the same the there i mean there several different forms every time they send out the test it sealed in a box and nobody is allowed to open it but the principal and then he has to distribute it to the teachers and a so the questions could change and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or uh how much of a uh how much do you have to have of the senate to pass a law yknow it could be something real real technical or something that a three year old could answer because it trying to hit yknow all the areas that you ve learned i think they re retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i don know well course the multiple choice there a right or wrong answer and but the writing they give you one point for each paragraph so you hafta get five points to pass now you might get four out of five and almost pass and then you hafta retake that one part well yeah that kind of subjective although there is a paper that we hand out to our kids that tells exactly what supposed to be in every part of this essay like the first the introductory paragraph supposed to consist of a way to capture the reader attention it suppose to supply background information it supposed to state your thesis statement which tells mainly what the pa paper paper gonna be about and then you re supposed to end the introductory paragraph by listing three ideas about your thesis that you re going to develop in paragraphs two three and four so i mean it well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the intr most people get ahead of themselves yknow before they tell you this was last summer and it was on a vacation to myrtle beach they re telling you about the surfboard that they got and how great they surfed when that really should come down in the body of the paper yknow most people just they assume the reader knows i always say to my kids pretend like you re writing for an alien nothing about this planet like i had my kids last week i had them all write how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they didn know i was gonna do this so after they get everything all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread and my peanut butter and my jelly and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no ad libbing no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote and i do exactly what they said if they say cover the entire piece of bread with peanut butter i cover both sides crust uh the entire piece of bread if they say reach in the bag and grab two pieces of bread i reach in the bag and grab them and by the time i get them out they ve got holes in them because to me that what grab means whereas yknow if you just said take or get i just i say well i just gonna because when you get in that in the work out in the work world there gonna be two things they care about about your writing is it useable and is it persuasive because usually when you re writing something in the workplace it either to explain something or it to persuade somebody to do something so if it not those two things it not it not writing that gonna make it in the world it i mean oh i have a few kids from time to time that said they want to be writers which yknow they have great ideas but usually they can they can tell you them but when they write it my kids usually they leave out words or they leave off a suffix at the end or and the sentence makes no sense yknow i have to call them up and go what does this say or does this say this yknow this is what i thought this said does that what that really says well here a perfect example the other day my kids my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here the animal i would be and here why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and their whether they travel in groups or alone and of what part of the world they mostly habitat what they eat all that okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he couldn figure out how to spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestibules said to me that can be wrong because the computer said that was a word i said that is a word come with me i ll show you what a vestibule is so we walked across the street to the church i said there a big that a vestibule does your animal eat those my animal eats mostly vestibules i mean you see the computer can be wrong he said i said well he di didn it didn spell vestibules wrong but i doubt if your animal eats parts of buildings perfect yknow or your computer can tell you that you spelled when you meant to spell we won we were victorious we didn one oh yeah uh uh well a lot of my kids do much better with writing on the computer because they know that they can go back and change it or fix it or they can get spelling help or they can even get grammar help or they can maybe even get syntax help i if it says this is awkward or something turn the sentence around so my students do a lot better with writing if they do it on the computer than if they are asked to do it pencil and paper so that what i make them do their webbing you know what a webbing is don you where you put web out an idea you and it looks like a spider web i make them do their webbing and get their rough draft started and then they can go to the computer because they i find they um they are a little more creative when they get to think about adding pictures and we call it publishing it when you get to the publishing stage you should have all your errors corrected even if you have to rewrite it six times i mean tha it just blows their mind when i say to them well the other day i wrote a letter to a senator and i had to write it six times i wrote the letter and rewrote it until it was perfect and every time i rewrote it it got better and i wrote it six times and i an english teacher and i tell them writing is not an event it a process it like getting your braces put on you go in one time and they might pull a couple teeth and you go in the next time they might put that little wire on then you go in the next time they might put the lower ones on or part of them and the next time then they put on more and then one time they ll tighten them a little but it a process that happens over a period of three years it not an event they think they can sit down and write okay i done i like i don think so writing is a yeah well and don you think yeah well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home or on your hard drive um because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft or i ll say to my students have your mom look it over have your sister look it over have somebody else proofread it because you re not gonna see the mistakes because you re too busy thinking about the content of what you wanted to say and you re not gonna notice them spelled i or they a yeah or a sentence that too long or a sentence that a fragment and it isn a complete thought you re not gonna notice that because you know what it was supposed say so give it to a friend or somebody and let them just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they don understand and that will really help you oh well i had a i had a student bring me a paper today he said this is for history i have to write an essay on anthony wayne okay my parents are still married i from i lived there all my life i was born here in columbus so i really haven known anything else um have a dog named sammy i work in the dorms as a night assistant and i have a girlfriend right now yeah yeah my dog at home yeah i have two older brothers one ten years older the other one fifteen years older yeah um it didn seem that much stranger than anyone else i mean my the middle brother was always around he wasn very social in high school so yeah um i a pre art major right now hoping to get into computer animation freshman i went to it the new high school there yeah high school a lot of people are really narrow minded and work on really trying to fit in in college people are more open idea like open minded and they re more willing to express their own ideas i was more comfortable here than in high school you don see like the big cliques like the popular abercrombie wearing or like all the art students hanging out together it a big mix of people and everyone doing their own thing um freshman sophomore year yes after that i quit wrestling and i just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else sports is definitely part of a clique you try to be part of the and the team tries to do everything the same so everybody trying to be like everyone else it was part of that i started wrestling because a lot of my friends did so i mean basically the entire winter i either doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends so the whole reason i quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight i was really starting to feel it physically yeah i was cutting twenty pounds in three days dehydration you run around in three pairs of sweat suits and vinyl jump suit over that under heaters you sleep in three pairs of sweats so you lose about two and a half pounds in your sleep it is that why i quit by the end i was pretty much just puking up blood and passing out a lot there were a lot of teammates that were cutting that much weight if not more they were pretty much doing it for the team yeah by then it was junior year when we were wrestling and everyone just figured it was two more years left they could just struggle through it it definitely did because i would sleep probably the eight hours right after practice until i woke up in the morning i delivered the columbus dispatch in the morning too so it was pretty much deliver papers go to class wrestling sleep almost all the parents did but he bring in nutritional list or whatever to explain to the blah blah blah so yeah not that i know of none of the other sports teams were so inclined to like push their athletes to cut weight or to do anything extreme to their bodies um hum and the lower you are apparently the easier it is or something that was the coach philosophy anyway some of them are athletes they re pretty much just student council i good at school but bad outside of school they go out and party outside of school but they join all like the students against drugs programs so they re really hypocritical there a little bit well quite a bit of it was yeah some of the people in the group didn play sports but it wasn all from one sport or it was football wrestlers it was usually like the best football players the best wrestlers in high school yeah i was friends with most of them but i just didn hang out with the entire crowd yeah it wasn so much of a hate thing it was just more these are the people i like to hang out with you don like that that fine our school wasn really a violent one there weren really any fights or anything it was mostly caucasian and very few asian and other ethnicities yeah my roommate actually had that teacher and none of the allegations are true she was alleging that students were writing racial slurs on their desks and stuff but i had friends in classes of hers and none of them wrote any they never saw it they never said anything about it we hear um and now that the most newsworthy story out there so i think yeah the press have a lot to do with it the media well hide in your basement i guess and i i i but i mean what you can not as an individual uh well see that a problem it hard to find a balance between censorship and yknow free flow of information uh and as long as people i mean some people like this information uh jerry springer still running which i i actually kind of enjoy watching once in a when i get the ch it kind of interesting to watch these um but i mean i mean where do you draw the line what people should see and not see i don know i don want somebody telling me i can see something or telling me what my kids can see uh i that my job and if i don wanna see something on tv i ll turn it off if i don want my kids to see something on tv we ll i have an argument it used to be easy when they were little yknow now yknow you re dealing with a a twenty one year old an eighteen year old is not as easy yeah yeah you re much bigger and you can control the thing and keep it away from her uh yeah but but i don want somebody else telling me what they can watch and not watch that my job but i don know how you i mean the the media per supposedly i mean may not supposedly this may be the way it works the media presents this stuff and people watch it or read it ju or whatever they don but it when it like the constant barrage that this is what you get the monica lewinsky stuff and every day there was a new twist on the story that or they announced that the news was that there wasn a news twist yeah i don care but you couldn turn it off because that all that was on i don know well they are now in a sense uh it easier to to go somewhere else i think on the web on tv if you have yknow like four news cha four local news channels and they re all saying the same thing and emphasizing the same things there no choice there if you want the news you re gonna get it one way or the other but on the web you can go somewhere else uh and yknow major newspapers are all over the web uh you can pick and choose and you can see different perspectives on the same story from different parts of the country and i think you get a a wider view yeah well yeah yeah oh that was the monica lewinsky i think it been good i mean the economy has been very good uh it seems like society seems to be improving yknow even though we talked about this crime and stuff i i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the republican years and carried over um but people have been better off financially overall uh and i and i don think he made anybody i don i wouldn say he made any major mistakes policy wise well yes the his personal life he well yeah he really just yeah he just doesn think through the implications of things real well in his personal life well yeah he does back down too often i think uh you uh well yknow the well the health insurance didn have a chance i mean i no matter what position he took on the health insurance trying to radically change things it wasn gonna get through congress and so yeah he backed down but i would ve liked to have seen something else happen to it but it was also he i mean he gave up because it was it was useless to fight it he didn think it wasn gonna get through congress so why spin your wheels on that i mean he raised the issue it was clear that it wasn gonna go anywhere and maybe it ll it i think it regrettable it hasn come back yeah but he pretty much out of the picture now as of this week um the gays in the military i mean they ve always been there i really uh they ve always been there um i don have problems being around gays um i never have my yknow have a brother in law who gay my son godfather gay it not a problem um oh clinton position on it well he sort of backed down from what it was gonna be and then just hoped that it would drop and i mean what what you hear and read lately is that it really hasn changed much uh and it but again that i think part of that too is society not ready on some level to accept that i mean gays in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gay marriages and well uh was it was they actually had a law or they or was it referendum oh really i hadn heard that know it it uh some of it when clinton has backed down i think i sorta summarized what i just said is yknow for the health insurance and reform with that all that health insurance area um yeah he backed down but it wasn gonna happen so he could keep know the furor going for months and months or years and still nothing was gonna happen it was the wrong time or mo try to move on to something else uh i think it regrettable it hasn come back like you said it like well i made the one attempt and didn go anywhere so let let it drop and count for somebody else to pick it up well clinton in lame duck it why can he bring it back it a good ti i mean what are they gonna do i mean he been through enough hell on his personal life this can be much worse i wouldn think uh and he does ba he does back down i think too much on stuff like that and yknow that a time if they can say it in three months they can say it in eight months oh george oh i don know i haven really formed an opinion i can i can see a lot of substance uh he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then sorta ba not really backtrack it just like it not anything really firm i mean with mccain and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was what the points they wanted to make and that i don hear that coming from bush well i don i hear some of that from gore but not as much it ll be a campaign i thought it was interesting that that gore suggested reco suggested two campai two debates a week and i just can imagine watching two debates a week for months it like well at least they could get things out into the open but i they have the chance but who wants to watch that much who has the time to watch that much yeah i don think we need eight months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries it just too long uh people start tuning out and there only so much you can say yknow it like the candidates yknow hooking up real tight with guys but he really likes these guys well um see he moved into an apartment over on eleventh avenue and it got broken into and uh yknow he paying rent on this apartment and he back home because the police said that this apartment has been hit many times so it just a big mess right now yknow had uh uh nice uh je yknow his better clothes stolen his jewel yknow jewelry um few other minor things but he didn want his tv and and those kind of things to get stolen so he moved them back home and then he started worrying about something else and that moves back then he worried about his car because somebody down the street got their car stolen so it just uh gonna be a matter rearranging he um applying for another scholarship he gets some already so if he would get this other scholarship i think it uh would help him uh be able to move into the fraternity uh i think he can get out of the apartment by subleasing it he has to get the seventy five dollars to give to the landlord to they charge seventy five to do that to advertise and um screen yknow do the screening yeah oh boy they re just really fun people to deal with they had a two by four on the door for over a month nailed over it instead of replacing the door so yeah company and they they uh they re the biggest landlord on campus i believe yeah so yknow his friend lives on the other side yknow it like a duplex and his friend lived on the other side and he uh he also was uh broken into they came through his bathroom window yknow the police said that they ve been there many times yknow but yknow kids they have to learn these things on their own i mean he twenty two i still consider him a kid but they have to learn these things on their own yknow when you go to look for apartment what you need to look for and what you need to check out yknow are you going to be able to afford it and everything that goes with it and have a work study job yknow um hum he wants to yeah yeah well he thinks he can do it yeah yeah it a lot of money but my son he just he so uh i mean i don know if you ve ever met anybody that totally into politics have you ever met somebody like that and yeah he like that uh he wanted to but uh something in his schedule interfered with it um hum yeah i ve i think because my dad was no i don work for politics no no i i interested yeah what goes on in the community uh goes on uh yknow nationally yknow especially interested in this presidential election well i thought it went the way it was supposed to go yeah yeah uh somebody gotta get get yknow put george bush to the back i an independent i i don like i i don i don i mean i my uh i guess my uh mom was a democrat and my dad was a republican and uh maybe that why yknow it like that but historically yknow my dad people were democrats but then they turned republican because they thought they were supposed to turn republican i guess but uh yknow there there some of the conservative values that are very important to me yknow but then there some social things that are real important too so um hum and some conservative values too yknow that the republicans are supposed to represent but i don think they they are doing a very good job of that you can be an independent yeah but i ve i ve never voted in the primary my son said that uh i need to but i not real interested in voting in the primary yeah i could have you ever heard him speak he like this robot yknow every time you they ask him a question it like it been scripted and it over and over and um he doesn seem like he real bright and i i really feel like if you re gonna run for president of the united states you ought to be smart really smart bill clinton is smart and i i don like clinton but he really smart and gore seems to be really smart bradley seems to be smart and mccain maybe maybe not so smart but he smart enough he exper experienced politician too but uh yknow gore you just kind of look at that and say well uh yknow the republicans are desperate yknow yeah yeah so they knew that this bush name would bring out a lot of money which it has he got a lot of money to work with and yknow that doesn seem fair either i don think yknow the average person in united states the average person uh doesn think that your politicians should be bought yknow not necessarily but yknow i like him to beat a candidate right anything anybody but that bush and i sure don want to vote for al gore yknow it terrible you don have too many options yknow yeah yeah they say it gonna be hard to do in some of the other states but i don think so against him in a lot of ways uh well my son he worked on the coleman campaign so of course uh yknow i had to get out and yknow help him put the signs out and all that kind of stuff i got the bumper sticker got some people in my family some bumper stickers neighbor oh you vacuumed oh it so nice in here thank you yknow and and that good yknow there are a lot of people out there that uh wouldn even notice the fa fact course then there are the days when i don get around to it i know he must right right it it amazing and that something i know my husband we always joke about he talks tells his guys at work yknow like um yknow to take flowers for no reason yknow well like like one guy was telling he was saying something about it was their anniversary and peter said well are you gonna take flowers home and he guy goes oh i don know and pete said trust me some flowers this will be and and the guy came back next time and he said yeah i had a real good weekend yknow was a good and it true if you show each other over and over that they re really you re really value them it just back to you yeah right right exa right and then they wonder wha yknow i don know what it the other who changed yknow and if you you start your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way that old golden rule thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it it sure works for me yeah yeah i can see um hum uh huh yeah right right um hum right oh what are you doing that for oh that funny right right well see we have real traditional um break down of of chores but only because tha that that just happened to be what we like to the way we like it do you know what i mean and it it not um because yknow i consider our my whole house a lot of feminists yknow we re all real strong about that but the thing is since i have the luxury of being at home and peter doing a job that really enjoys and i am doing something i enjoy i really am happy to do all of those things that typically women do because that my job that my trade off yknow i don have to go someplace else i can get i can go and have coffee everyday with my daughters i can go sh shopping yknow do whatever i want and i happy to do these other things and so yknow even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it not it not because i to it not because he yknow he wouldn do something that that something else it this suits me fine and so that a whole different that real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same right which is what we look like but it not right right um hum right exactly right right right right i that another thing that that we re i at odds with with my were that they don understand the fact that why would i go to college i for it myself i worked my way through school i was so proud the fact that i was like only a quarter late than my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was paying for it as i went and and i didn have any loans i was when i was done it was for and so um course tuition was a hundred twenty five dollars a quarter but i was only making yknow fifty cents an hour at the beverly across the street on neil avenue so um uh but anyhow yknow they never understand yknow well you di didn you never got a job with it yknow why would you go to school and waste all that money i it was the best money i ever spent i don under i mean and it was my money why should it matter right well why do you have to do anything with it yeah yeah right but still my name julie my oldest daughter were for a long time she was ith in in and would say to me how do you feel about that and i said what do you mean how i feel about that yknow she can always wait tables as long as she can herself self what do i care and then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology and now as it turns out she going to um she just started back she the one that having the baby though she just started back and uh to get certified to teach elementary school because we ve talked so much about what whe where where would she do well and she she would just do so well she really good wi she such a herself she really good with with kids maybe second third grade she so into animals and so into science and understands different kids so that yknow i i think she would be fabulous there and so she kind of decided i if but if that if she just ends up not doing that i won care either well we don wanna know she the only one that wants to know her her um boyfriend doesn wanna know either and so sara decided that she could not go and find out the sex of it because she couldn keep a secret yeah so so anyhow we don we just don know it due december second but she already dilating and everything so the doctor had said before thanksgiving he thinks yknow we re excited it ll be fun in any pregnancy three weeks in either direction is considered full term yeah so she funny because she gained twenty six pounds and yet she doesn look pregnant she has on she had on a regular sweater today and it she kind of big chested she my height but the baby is like all undern you don it i mean unless you push her shirt down it just like it it just amazing to me to be that pregnant and not be able to even hardly look like it so oh really yeah yeah a little yeah it just amazing when she went to her lamas class she said mom you wouldn believe it half these uh they couldn get up off the floor or anything they were all having trouble and she said there i was with my cupcakes and my cheetohs yknow and she said they all had bottled water and were very yknow but she like i said she just turned twenty eight she so i don know i she doesn move anymore than she has to i the one that loves to exercise oh i do some yoga and i do some some weights and i have a stepper that i absolutely love i can i have it down now so i can if that happened i would be ten times more understanding and i would say yknow i would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes and yeah i yeah i shouldn have done that so now let just go get some more furniture do you know what i mean and and she always says oh mom it was fine she said i got to do a whole lot of things you won let them do now for that now that i know better so ey it she she always very generous about it and says she had more time alone with me and because i got divorced when she was or her i split up with her dad when she was about a year and a half and so for until she was six it was just she and i so we had a lot of time together and she says she thinks that was worth it it was okay to put up with my trying to learn how to be a parent in exchange for having me all to herself in a i kno oh my god oh well see my fa father my husband would do that though it so bizarre because is i don know what i don i honestly don i think that where his brain is completely lacking i make i get to make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can do and we all understand this and it perfectly fine and he says i not a good judge of that you ll have to check wi because my son when my son was like eleven he let him come to campus with his skateboarding friends i said where are they oh they said they were going down on ca i said on campus over my dead body he not allowed down there and so i it it the thing is though it almost like i really glad that willing to say i just can make those de uh he let he let my daughter who thirtee he left left her at the movies one night they went to the movies there was no um the movie they went to see was sold out the next one wasn gonna start until nine thirty which means this kid years old so that would have been eleven thirty twelve owk clock yknow at the lennox he leaves her there with one of her friends some boy and although this tom boy who just amazing but so anyhow uh he left her there and uh they said they called me but i diy didn i was running the sweeper so i didn hear the phone so left her there and he said that she was gonna call back yknow at at a certain time and i was gonna tell her what she could or couldn do so i said yknow well you re gonna have to come he home yknow he gonna have to come and get you oh come no we re not gonna do that i you know you can be this late so he went back down picked them and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven then his parents can pick him up and everybody was annoyed my husband said a i would ve let her stay i don understand why you re doing this i don care i want her to come home the other well the bottom line it was hysterical because she and this little boy they re outside and he they re jumping and he jumping on the trampoline i go out to him and i introduce myself and i say yknow honey i said really sorry about the plans but i just you couldn a i just could not let you guy her stay there that long he goes oh that okay my mom would never let me do that so and i thinking yknow here a all everybody acting like i the bad guy and i i the one who into right and so there was i just wanna tell you one more thing that was funny because um there was something she wanted to skip a play rehearsal that i wouldn let her skip because it was for a party that her friends were having and i understood it was important to her but when you have commitments you you keep your commitments and so was saying he agreed with me and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case she goes so what with him he never has an opinion how come all of a sudden he allowed to have an opinion tell me what i can do yknow it was really funny we laughed about it and i let her um i let her skip because i decided that it was so important to her so yeah but it was just so funny yknow i know we talked too long but this is so much fun do you have a three clock we gotta go okay that when you take him to grandma that what we do heh nto he got to grandma night because we live with my mom and dad so he gets to see my side all the time but he doesn get to see them as much so it like when that night comes along good go to grandma or like we take to to her like movies and when we want to go see a movie and because his mom gets uh those free tickets for a for um not getting hurt she works at fedex and um her crew is always getting hurt mainly her uh she ran a forklift a into a and brok busted her nose and chipped her tooth she just a dangerous woman and um so uh she gets a lot of tickets sometimes when she getting hurt when she not running into poles stuff um and yknow we ll use them because they don they normally go to the movie store and just get a movie and bring it home we do that a lot too but we haven been there in a while but i mean we do go not since the new year started we haven been i like scary um i think he into scary action yknow like whatever his name is arnold schwarzenegger he into his kind of movies i like the i liked sixth sense i loved that movie that movie was good makes you think like right now i cold and when you see it you ll know what i talking about like coldness we well you watch the movie you re like whoa oh yeah i all i always wear shirts i don i a shirt person i don like things on my arms like like i don like bracelets or anything yeah i guess i just have the nerve to scratch and stuff like my rings i ll twist them because they bother me like i don wear this a whole lot and it one of the days i did oh yeah well clown cone isn there clown cone uh you could get like a bag of um tootsie rolls and pay only five cents so um that gone and that was a kid thing um my grandfather used to own im market and uh the changes at and is like a lot it got robbed a lot more because my grandfather kept a shotgun underneath the counter but um um easton um easton is crazy um crazy bad like the prices in the stores are like way outrageous to me crazy um the mall i don even like north land mall i wish would stay because i mean it close to where i live um i ve been going there all my since i was born probably um so that and i heard i kind of liked the change they re talking about they re talking about putting underground power lines and taking the poles out and putting like the the street lights they have at easton so i think that kind of nice i am not agreeing with mah my grandma see she seems to think okay maybe but if you put a discount store in there i would love it that what she said i was like no where north land is when north land moves and all that that the existing building she thinks they should turn into a discount store the there this one that like out in wisconsin or something she said and was really nice and she had been there like a couple of times and she says they should put one right she said that ll make up for it um i hear i know my aunt works at penney i know penney and lazarus are both moving their existing stores to polaris so there ll still be a sears and a lazar or i mean penney and a lazarus but they re moving to polaris um and i i don know if they re gonna tear down that bui i don know what they re gonna do with that existing area mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something feed them or something yknow that a big building what are you what you gonna do with it um like a little coffee shop like the continent there apartments above them yeah hum put bathrooms and kitchens and stuff i like computers i like yeah we um we have two computers in our house and they both have internet on them and um the it called all advantage and they ll pay you to go to websites and it like twenty five cent an hour or something i don remember what it was but we haven got a check yet but i not sure i don know his his dad found it and told me about it because i wasn working at the time and we were trying to get an extra income to come in and um his dad made actually like twenty five dollars or something yknow i would think he make more than that because man every time we go over there he up on the computer doing something so and i on there yknow just i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff um yknow like reading about things that happen to people like their kids spitting up in their face or something um yknow it stuff like that it like it kind of neat because you don have to pay well you have to pay for it but like magazines i like it better than a magazine something like that i don i don know much about it but i think get computers is going to really dominate yknow i mean soon like fedex and all it probably gonna be there probably gonna be no one working there they re probably gonna make it all sh machinery yknow but then you ll have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery so hey yeah i haven done that yet i haven bought anything off the internet yet i don know something about giving my credit card number away is kind of hum um i don think so oh yeah i was like my ed was like oh i got to figure out how to do well it like you can do that flipped out yeah he he broke into like oh my god i can remember what it was but he had all these numbers for credit cards and he was threatening to uh sell them on the internet if they didn give him what he wanted i was like and ed was like oh we could get i was like no nah oh did they i don think so i don think so i don think they did um but there was this other guy my mom was talking about the other day i don know what she seen it on i guess he had did something like that and yknow he was just listing they did like an interview with him and um told them how much yknow things he did like he did this and that and i guess he broke into bank ones or something like that and got some accounts or something like that and i was like whoa yeah that is oh yeah yeah i could check my account see how much money i have i got and they ll actually list things that i ve bought yknow like how many your your esigsting account and all that what you ve bought check clearing so you can see if checks cleared do my um billing and stuff microsoft money okay thing is extraordinarily similar um so what she says might not might be diametric opposed to what i say but how she got there she started out somewhere is often so similar to where i coming from that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that yeah there a lot there there ch way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i was like okay i ll go to europe oh yeah later next afterward mm hmm mm hmm london paris prague budapest amsterdam venice vienna berlin munich uh there probably some more on there but that all of the ones that jump off there like a a a little hit list in my head obviously and another hit list in my palm pilot life is good can i just say yes i like lots of stuff um i like games predominantly i like i like playing um i like puzzles i like challenges i don like jigsaw puzzles um i like anything that involves fixing it i don mind breaking things either because then you have something to fix afterwards made me a very bad latchkey child i am uh i don actually think that i i i could call myself an engineer amongst engineers but uh i think if i was calling myself an engineer to a psychologist it would be okay mm hmm mm hmm yeah says double major yeah i ll just keep them as friends that works um i don think it ever really occurred to me honestly i don think it ever really occurred to me ri they they like hmm everybody else is taking double but i having fun over here doing this computer science thing and happy joy yeah maybe i should go back get a degree in electrical engineering that would be a lot of fun even if they don pay me it still be fun so am i um i missed your question before that i play with computers um normally when people ask me i tell them what i did that day or what i did the day before if they ask me in the evening or so um what did i do today what i do today internet information server is a product by microsoft it lets you house web pages and put them out on the web index serve is another product that lets you put search engines on that um then there another product by a company called splitcycle it called netstock it sucks netstock basically goes out to yahoo and checks to see what the stock prices on something are and so i made netstock iis and index server all play nicely together today both um today i was farmed out to bank one i yesterday was monday i was farmed out to bank one friday farmed out to bank one but now i ve resolved all those three issues and they don have anything else to throw at me interesting so i leaving tomorrow i ll be back at the home office working on some other stuff that will benefit us in franchising because franchising is a much better way to make money than selling time for for money selling time for money for money sucks mm hmm selling time for money yes oh yeah yes muchos money familiar with sarcom yes yeah but it not a good way for me to make money if you re farming out people or if you re better still drop it down a level if you are exchanging hours for money or time for money then you have a finite amount of time and that sucks should have some other thing to exchange for money i would much rather exchange ideas for money or previously done work for money or something obnoxious and stupid like a franchise for money i in favor of that i come up with a good system by which to do things i sell it to you you go do those things i sit around and make money off of your efforts yeah that so sure um going into business for myself i need something to sell and selling my own time doesn actually seem to be a worthwhile endeavor i ve done it i ve already done independent consulting wherein i set up a contract and said hi you pay me i ll do this thing and i go do that thing and you make a lot of money like that problem is you get taxed obscenely like that because you don have an employer paying half your taxes for you and um there other bunches of overhead involved and there the constant cycle of marketing oneself and it all depends on how much you wanna market yourself marketing yourself is easier for some people than for others and it more fun for some people than for others so far i don know if i it a lot easier to market yourself beggars i love it mm hmm end of march i don have a plane ticket yet i have a eurail pass though yes yes hi i approachable do do do bruge in belgium bruge in belgium so i have a game going on with a good friend of mine named michelle i have this stupid ring here you see the ring so um i have lost something like two incarnations of this ring just flat out lost them because well ah i an irresponsible cuss and um one of them a third if you will i gave to her or more accurately i think she took it but it a fine line and so she wears that around and replaced it so i had my own again i wear this one around so we have a competition to see who can get the most well traveled ring you get two points for every country and you get one point for every state or province within that country uh it counts if you re touching the ground or if something that you re sitting on is touching know well you you get to take advantage of it for layovers and stuff it it pretty cool mm hmm i i don hate all mm hmm okay well i not adopting that rule and fortunately the judge of our game isn listening to our conversation so i feel kind of safe a mutual friend uh much better friend of mine than of hers but she more attractive than i am so we figured it all balanced out we decided that made him unbiased mm hmm she has already been to europe twice sadly and has accumulated all of forty four thirty four points yeah and two for country one per state or province no no once you re in it you re been in it and that it i have thirty two points belgium what do you think western europe netherlands holland doesn know his geography for shit for the record i ve already learned an immense amount looking at my eurail thing okay so belgium is okay okay not only toward with us the children but just to other also yknow how mother used to feed the bums that would up to front door and she fix them food and so she she was a very hum i i know i wasn um hum um hum i think example is probably the best um they see that you care and they learn to care i think my son john he the youngest i think he a very compassionate soul uh very spiritual young man um more so than his brother is and i always have th that ah have to weigh that yknow they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel better to give and i sometimes try to weigh that if that part of why i i i i can believe it it an attention getter because there nothing to be gained by getting attention for the works you do but um but maybe just within maybe one feels um and i think we i think it it a matter of being conscientious too yknow conscientious that there are less fortunate out there and that there little things we can do i think that kind of where i coming from janet i know you i janet janet i mean what my sister does ah i just say to her i just really admire it i can give as much as she gives i can just don have that same spirit she has but uh is it great to see i mean she real she really when she with the people i don know i have this thing probably about me that yknow you can stand on your own two feet and you can lead a better life but janet just envelops them with her kindness and um probably has less expectations from the people she works with hum oh help them yeah um hum um hum um hum um hum very much so um hum i do uh huh yeah no i don go to mass everyday but i go on sunday three three out of my four children do belong to the catholic church and then my one daughter chose in living in oklahoma she is in a baptist church but she very active within the church very active through the sunday school and okay one two three four five testing testi when i was a kid my father got this tape recorder in the days when they were those big yknow the wheels and god only knows he get a half a dozen drinks in him then he go around the house testing testing say a few words for po posterity and we used to think get him out of here yknow i guess that what it is but i don have a video camera either but i as soon as you said that i thought i could just see him yknow oh drove me ah tq say a few words for posterity he say and we say get out of here no i i um have very little contact with them and so that be about the last thing i be okay where are we i ll start asking you questions so that yeah okay uh eh convenient in what way um hum right right tremendous demand right now um hum um hum and you ve been going to ohio state that whole time you should be getting pretty near excuse me i guessing is it right sounds good oh i yeah exactly i was just wondering how could i get a job doing what you re doing i grew up in masillon ohio i the oldest of five children i have four children my own i uh i was i was married many years ago and then i ve been married to my husband now for twenty one years and we have um three children together so i have a daughter twenty eight daughter at nineteen who a sophomore at ohio wesleyan my older daughter a graduate from ohio i a graduate of i have a son who uh nin uh let see joe is he fifteen he a sophomore at high school and i have an eighth grade daughter at and um i a homemaker i have a degree in sociology i ve been at home since my a second daughter was born with my second marriage and i consider it a luxury and a privilege and i just absolutely love being at home i do a lot of volunteer work um i real involved with the school system columbus with columbus public and uh i like organizing big projects for them um my husband director of engineering for liebert and so that why i know what you re thinking yeah and whenever i complain about the weather in columbus he always says we ll go anywhere you want where would you like to live well i wanna stay here i don wanna go anywhere yet til all my kids are ready and then my daughters always say okay mom as soon as we re all done with school then we can all move to california but we have to go as a group because i real real close to to my children yeah really close i i sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working yknow with my oldest daughter i worked but i arranged my life around her so that even though i had that degree i waited tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her was with her all day then when she started school i switched over to lunches and so i ve always arranged my life around my children so i have an opportunity to be with them they get better and better and better i he hear i i really lucky um yknow everyone always crabbing about their horrible kids and my kids are phenomenal we have this arrangement i do everything i possibly can to make them happy and they do everything they possibly can to make me happy and it like um my my oldest girl she sh we re expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks and she and i see each other all the time my daughter who goes to chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her and um it not that these girls aren independent and can do it on their ow they re megan could my second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was twelve i mean she just a very very mature very driven the only problem she has she didn have a job to support herself other than that she could have taken care of herself but sh she chooses to still at home and be a part of our life and um my son he both those kids have four points i mean they really work hard in school because they know it important and my son was uh he was the only ti time only one that was in seventh and eighth grade he took that time to do the maturing that most of his friends are doing at sixteen and so i really lucky that we had our difficulty at that point and uh and it was minimal but to me having been used to everything being perfect yknow was like it was like for him to have um for him to not make the honor roll every time i couldn even imagine what was happening with him and now he completely back on track and doing really well and my eighth grade daughter is um she my kids are involved in all kinds of different things she real involved with theater um she yeah everything that comes along yknow she wins the science fair she get does the power of the pen she is on student coun they all have lots of different kinds of things that they re involved in and that i incredibly proud of them because they re just they re and they re really they re not geeky and goofy they re really neat neat kids that kids like so they re they are they re wonderful everybody always says to me rachel i just don know what you re doing will you come and take care of mine for me and it it the fact that i have a tremendous respect for my kids i mean i really value their opinions and i treat them everybody says your mom weird she talks to us strange it because i talk to them like i talk to you at at whatever age they are yknow i don yeah i don talk down to kids i sure sure yeah over the years we ve had situations like that yknow a pregnancy here and there and things that people needed to get worked out or someone being worried about i uh i a neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do with it and about it so yeah but yknow i it it i just lucky i so lucky right oh i sh i sure of the fact that my parents um my mother tried real tries really hard but my my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so that he insisted yknow he he could drink on the weekends and never miss work etcetera yeah there was no problem and uh um but the biggest problem is the fact that he and i i um i i exp i ve always expected to have some sort of a respect from them and because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and think for myself and so i exactly what they always said they wanted it just that they can handle that and so when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot in a lot of trouble about um the racial thing because uh i from a school where i was mostly white students were almost the minority it was a pretty even it a very it a low income neighborhood and when i in seventh grade i remember going home and saying was everybody the same and being told well of course they are so i went to school and told everybody i was in love with danny flowers who happened to be black and i got called into the office and they called in a social worker and they i was punished i wasn allowed to uh i was grounded for the year and they never called this kid in i i then i thought this whole thing is so screwed up yknow wha what what wrong with these people they kept saying that they wanted to save this nithe white girl because i had so much potential and uh they weren going to let me throw my life away like this so i was yknow it bizarre and so i was always from that time on i decided these these people are all crazy i never gonna i never gonna be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values from my family and it real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to um hum yeah yeah so the covo um what are the are they high or oh oh really really so is it is that so like they the the economy good right now well right now uh sh shaky okay not too many dot coms apparently over there banking oka okay really okay i didn know i didn know there was like a effect for australia i thought yknow being separate meant yknow i know it connected to like yknow england because it like i guess that i guess uh i gue maybe like england owned it once so that really i know i it a site that isn that so it like same deal with canada yknow like how it used to be owned by okay but it like they it like a democracy over there i in australia they yknow it not they don have like a king and queen and okay okay she wouldn come in and say well off with your yeah oh is it really have you been there oh yeah i ge get i kno i i know there like some lot of people says well you can even go to vietnam now like why would yeah it like it like yeah yknow you can go you can go now to cuba but why would you it like it it just um hum be like going back in time so if you so yknow like modern conveniences yknow like toilets and the hot water yknow and oh really no they don have like your your basic amenities oh my gosh really um hum where it at are they like at the at the aren they like i thought those like aren the hospitals supposed to be like dormitories or yknow just yknow their the they they just provide you basics but there supposed to be like at least yknow i mean you get what you pay for okay um hum like what um hum okay oh but it more the that was more the exception than the norm so where in europe did you go where would you where actually where would you not recommend going okay oh sure you can go to europe really you just felt it was like just totally over overrated okay well at least you re honest about it yknow um hum is that right everything had grey poupon oh that fantastic and all the wine you can drink a little out of the way backwards okay yeah did you do do the da da dat don tell you do the tourist thing um hum um hum just always really rushed um hum really why that just because of the wall go go go visit a wall okay they when they took by the it was i think i remember that when they when they took that on the wall brandenberg gates or something like that okay i remember hearing that um hum say hi um hum you re like no no he back there trying to shoot me or because i i remember hearing horror stories yknow about people just dying yknow left and right just like yknow just dropping just to get out of uh out of out of east germany yknow and they don play they ll they they ll they they ll shoot they do shoot to kill just now just to just to walk back and forth is amazing oh um hum um hum yeah i just wear my glasses for more for yknow reading i can see far away i wish i could wear contacts no because i have a stigmatism because i yknow look glasses cut in right here and that irritating all right i wasn born here but i was raised here and i was raised here most of my life i was a baby yknow under one i was born in brooklyn new york that where my father from my father moved here yes with my mother um hum well um my uh grandmother was uh ill my mother mother and her sister would be my aunt she was uh care taking so my mother came here for that reason and they just stayed yeah they like they really like this town she was from kentucky appalachia he was from brooklyn and uh yknow i guess it worked for them uh huh right and not the yknow all that went on in yknow in new york the fast pace yes i do about i try to visit at least uh at least two every two years we either we go to new york or we meet half way kupwih years ago we met at penn state and uh so yknow the older ones are all dying off though so and peo yknow people don have big families like they used to yknow so kind of dwindling yes i do i have a brother and two sisters yeah they well yknow i the oldest we re all in columbus um hum i don know what it like to grow up uh anywhere else uh i know what it like uh kind of like where my cousin lived in new york because i go there in the summers but uh hum did i like growing up in uh how do you judge that yknow what do you compare that to i think that uh i yeah it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york yes um well because my cousins and uh uh they all have uh they re very yknow well educated they re more affluent and i think that uh maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there uh he was a uh railroad clerk yeah yeah he um traced freight whatever that means where the where they were going and and uh he worked in a trailer uh out in the yards yknow yeah yeah he so uh yeah he was strictly a union man yknow so he kept his he believed in the unions yknow so the railroaders was union yknow he always preached get a union job yknow course they don believe in the unions now like they used to yknow we really don know much about his life away yknow away from home as far as what he did i i sure that he probably did go to meetings but uh as far as being a leader or something like that he i know i don i sure he wasn no he didn he didn we didn know yknow anything about what he did or we found out more um after he died twenty years ago when he died um i was about thirty he was only fifty six uh he had an anorism he had uh high blood pressure which we knew about and uh he started um yknow not being himself so he went to the doctor and they did some tests and found out he had this anorism that had to be operated on right away and he died uh under the anesthetic of a heart attack um so it was very sudden and unexpected um hum right right um hum yeah no i ended up uh running away from home yeah i was a teenage run away no there was a lot of conflict at home um my dad uh had to support us uh there were four of us and our mother has disabilities and uh she was kind of crazy yknow not that i talking negative about my mother but she has um some uh neurological damage and uh a disease that affected her mind and of course yknow back then i didn really know that but there was a lot of conflict um so uh that what i did and i went to some uh foster homes and things like that and uh lived in delaware for a while yknow got out of highschool and got married right um hum i never went back home yeah i did um hum when i would run away from foster homes yeah i did that was that was horrible yeah there was a lot of them and they were not very good yeah right here in columbus in the short north not too far from here um hum well that used to be where yknow all the teenage teenagers went i don know if they still do that was a long time ago that always kind of been known for that yknow yeah they go yeah yeah i don know where they re going now but i tried volunteering yknow at picking them up doing a volunteer thing and i get calls all during the night to go pick these kids up because i thought i was doing something to help but yknow you re not helping them this these this these uh the it has uh setup where um they have safe places where kids can go when they run away yeah as i was teasing okay twenty eight years this is my twenty eighth year i have two more years to go and i get to and then i ll go retrain and probably do something else for another twenty years oh no no they move you around all the time when you terch when you teach kids with learning disabilities they move you to where the population is rather than move the kids to you so yeah i ve been in columbus and worthington are the two systems i ve been in but no though within those they can move you around from school to school i ve been at the same one now for this is my seventh year at the middle school it grace brethren christian middle school it part of worthington schools cause they annexed it i was in columbus for the first like six years i taught back in the early seventies and then i transferred to worthington in seventy six and i ve been there ever since no i didn really start out as a teacher i started out as a speech and hearing therapist but they kept giving me these kids that i couldn keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them so i got interested in the hyper activity and so i started taking classes about any kids with a and stuff and little by little first thing you know i had my masters in learning disabilities it was mostly just so i could learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy and then when i found out there were so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for because a lot of these kids have language deficits and language problems they they can yknow like express themselves on paper or they don he process things correctly auditorially so it the perfect background to work with kids i didn know i was doing that at the time but somebody must have been watching over me yeah yeah right i taught um well i was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever since that i ve been in uh huh and then when i got my masters no i did it no i did it during the weekends summers and the nights and took me about mm well i started teaching in nineteen seventy seventy one and then i i got my masters in seventy five so it took me four years that way no i never i just was smart enough to do it before i had kids well i was married but i didn have any kids once you re have kids you you not gonna be able to do that kind of a schedule but um yeah so i didn take off any time and then when i got my masters i ran into an old friend of mine who teaches in worthington and he said oh i the special ed director up there now we need a resource room why don you come up and interview for this position or that position or when i went up and interviewed for that position got another position but anyway it all worked well i guess i have to say i don necessarily like middle school but see when you get a special ed certificate you re certified kindergarten through twelfth so i did several years in a high school when i was first out of college i did high school first then i went to elementary while my kids were in elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning yknow and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i ve decided that i too old to keep up with these kids not only are they learning disability and a but they re middle schoolers and they have like hormones running rampant all over the outside of their bodies you can tell which is the hormones and which is the a and which is the learning disability but like i said i only have two more years to go so i guess i can live through that not my favorite age i guess middle oh yeah they were more settled oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade and eleventh they re little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they re gonna have to go to college and this is like the only life they re gonna get yknow they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything just a big joke yknow i gonna play in a rock band yknow they all think they re gonna be rock stars and drummers and and yknow they could care less about anything it hasn hit them yet this is my real life duh this is my one real life better not throw it away they waste time yknow they stuff they think everything they say is hilarious oh it just middle school i think it transitioning from childhood to adulthood is a tough time and um when you have all the other things going on like you can read and you can write and you can spell then it just even worse ik it ek it exacerbated even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class and they oh i don really so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but i guess i don i guess i don i don get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i don yell and scream at them a i mean realize they didn ask to have a learning disability i mean they and that they can they re not some teachers think they re just being belligerent and that if they wanted to straighten up they could and what i try to tell those teachers is they can change their learning disability anymore than you can change your brown eyes yknow they were born with it it genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just don learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces or teach it a different way it like teaching a math problem two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well that how they are yknow maybe they don learn well by listening maybe they don learn by by well by looking ae at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they re up moving around doing something yknow you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jumble up what you say you say page turn to page three ninety three or and they turn to three thirty nine in their book yknow and they think they did what you said it just like something mixed up between the actual eye and the ear and then it where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day in their shoes you probably have a lot of empathy for them well no actually in order to get in my room you have to be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify as a learning disability kid in other word the way you qualify in the state of is you have a thirty point discrepancy between your actual i and your daily performance in other words let say you have a hundred i but in all of your classes you re performing like a seventy i person would so if there a thirty point discrepancy in there ae and people see that you re bright a but yet you re just not getting it you re not able to write answers like you could say or you re not able to read things that other seventh graders can read that kind of clues us in and then the regular ed or somebody refers the child for testing and then if they qualify for help then we yknow they go to my room for certain classes most of my kids i have them for reading and english that not a shocking surprise i mean i rarely get a kid for math although we do have kids that are learning disabled and they don understand math either even though it very concrete no math is just you can say okay here three blocks you can touch them one two three take two away now there one i mean yeah you can say a noun is always gonna be orange and it gonna be slippery language is so much more abstract than math and science so the abstract areas like history and english and reading and literature that where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can write can read can spell can do all three or aren very good at any of them once in a while you ll see a good speller because he can remember the order in which the letters come but he might be a horrible reader and a horrible writer even though he can spell yeah and his comprehension of the words of other kids his age wouldn be what it should be generally speaking my kids are two to four years behind if if we really score sports i mean the game of sports not the administra the administration of sports is just as unethical as the business world it is unethical and it one of the biggest problems we have in our society because we ve emphasized sports along with the theater as being oh the way to and that the poor the poorest benchmarks you could have in terms of financial appreciation sure you thing is you market demands the uh dollar that type of thing well yeah let them do it but the thing is it gets almost be like a lawsuit case we are crazy and insane people again gets back to ethics do you think do you think i worth thirty million let me ask you let let me ask you question why in the hell are you coming and asking for thirty million don you think you re and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and then on top of it those people that participate in the um sponsors are just as bad well i think it was then a nice thing about we we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we didn see them that much we made a part that uh we communicated with the grandparents regularly and when we did i it was a special emphasized the fact that yknow kids wanna do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe some additional things to work for that uh the aspect we uh asked them if they wanted to go on um a project with the class so forth fine but you gotta participate in it too we we ll match you with what you come up with we made them part of the we gave them responsibilities they grew up with the aspect they learned by being around some older people uh which uh i think was good because uh again i said you bring up you get wisdom from that as long as you re listening to them people i don care what their age was they just blew them and so that plus you have they i think a understanding of um the schooling they came from um they went they went to private schools they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools and even when going to ohio state um compared to miami university i saw a difference i see a differences in the standards of the of the students uh but i believe and i ve seen it with my son going to ohio state that his morals that he gained through his uh pre college years are staying with him uh and i very grateful that there uh spiritual guidance i keep telling these guys guys my daughter and son excuse me that um yknow they come to me for answers now i think now i that something that probably the other problem is sometimes maybe the the the siblings the children do not have a parent to go to but again let me arate rei reiterate we don have a smooth marriage they saw us have difficult times and they saw us saw us our spouses crying together forgiving one another arguing with another just as much as you can have a being human relationship they saw that they saw the love for one another they saw over night where i start take caring for my dad because my mother died instantly yknow like short term an hour and now he has a stroke i didn know whether i stay out of their and i had to learn all that i had take of but then they saw my over some my role at so we swing them that why i said a team we knew what we had do uh my son might come home i said well gee yknow he he he might smart off my wife will say hey that your dad give him respect oh okay okay it part of growing up and i i ve been there done that too but still you have to you have to um know there respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and not just demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they saw the interaction with the elderly people the school he went to a lot of public involvement public service required the teachers i often ask the teachers i ve gone to sporting events and their teachers are there ticket uh monitoring the crowd wherever the kids i ask them i said do you guys ever go home said oh yeah i said but they re always there they re not there just teaching a class they re not there preparing the class they re there after the class they re there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy at home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock oh time to quit they re gone those people don know meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves little more with somebody that having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i didn say willing to work not knowing they re going to be compensated because they ll be compensated not necessarily materialistically they ll be mantaw more than they re expected they ll be recompensated somewhere but the thing is to lend an open hand not knowing well gee what for what in it for me what in it for you is uh intangible are you willing then then you have a choice there you would not necessarily uh have you should ve had more self control and not had the child don expect me to pay for your uh lack of uh will power that that is a selfish attitude that stealing as well um hum um hum i sure somewhere i sure somewhere along the line that they would work things out to try to help her over those bumps it wouldn be long term and they would know that it would not be long term but that the intangible i saying you have somebody there because she giving up her time and not to make the high bucks but sh what she bringing about is developing a character in a person to bring about the spirituality in a person that gonna carry them all through life she tithing more than probably uh which uh i always uh kid with people i said the author said ten percent tithing knew inflation he knew great about economics ten percent is ten percent and then uh on top of that yknow we talked about economics uh little further here uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and the chi and germans so forth and uh boy yknow taking that page out of the old bible aren they we don oh yeah yeah definitely so my daughter definitely it cause she was working for campus crusade for christ and she came home one weekend from uh oxford and um okay um i i lived in columbus my entire life thirty four years um born and raised on the west side of columbus um um i a um it kind of a unique position i guess i a um my job title is a senior research associate um i received my um bachelors masters and nurse practitioner all from here from and i working down at dodd hall in a research position i also a nurse practitioner down there that um sees patients in follow up and in clinic um they sort of created the position for me about a year ago after i had my little boy um working on three different um research projects with three different physicians two are um specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at long term outcomes in people that have sustained traumatic brain injuries the other one is a drug study um looking at control of agitation and the other one is a um spinal cord injury research study it no it a uh clinical study where we re seeing how treadmill training effects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury so they re kind of spread out twenty five twenty five ten percent that kind of how it divided out between the projects um hum um a nurse practitioner has more authority i guess to diagnose and see patients um the state of ohio is i think the only state that has a given um nurse practitioners prescriptive authority where we can write our own prescriptions so we can see patients do the physicals we can suggest medications i guess per se but then the physician has to come in confirm our findings and then he actually writes the prescriptions yes and that what i like correct exactly exactly but we re working on it we ve gotta couple house bills in right now and see how things go be exciting yes i love ohio state but i don i guess from a career perspective they say it not a good idea to get all your degrees from one place but i don intend to ever leave here so i love yes yes yes i uh um uh lordy um grew up on the westside i went to my husband went to um proximity wise is probably within a mile of each other we were kind of high school sweethearts and the whole bit um his dad still lives in grove city my mom lives still at our old family house there on the westside and we moved um also on the westside probably couple miles from my mom no no no for me personally um family being close uh both sides of the family are here um for me familiar i don like a lot of change a lot of new things um for me i was involved in i i swam for swimming an got real involved with the sports an just the sporting programs an i love ohio state football so i i like the sports there a lot of activities to do to now with my little boy going to cosi and the zoo and just knowing where things are and how to get around so family um familiarity and um just the community i think crime i think it going and up um traffic is but the one to but i mean you need to go through that right now because columbus is expanding so much that we need the orange brailles and um i guess the lack of publicity nationally i i we don have yknow like the national football teams and now with the hockey coming i think were getting more recognition but when people talk about columbus they then i don think they know columbus ohio or columbus georgia or columbus where right right have right i don know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing with um chief jackson and the whole um mayoral candidates how they re getting in debates over that an i know this is something new on top of that um i know it was the front page on sunday paper i looked at it briefly um i think there must be some truth to it i don know the extent oh it possible but i can imagine it would uh not knowing how big it going to get i guess i can imagine that it going to well it might make national news i just it was on national news you see i not that informed on that um there so much negativity on the national news i don know if that ll just be blended in or if people will associate that with columbus right uh two and a half yes yes cosi going to be opening up on the sixth um looking forward to doing that we had a um uh seasons pass to wyandotte lake spent a lot of time at the pools um different swim centers hunter different rec centers the programs are excellent even here at ohio state they ve got the um um recreational sports on sunday afternoons where they can go um we go to the zoo a lot libraries have story times reading hours those type of things um just all kind of community things easter egg hunts at the rec centers um yeah um up until march he was at home with my aunt with family watching him in our home an then my grandfather who ninety five got um ill and my aunt had to choose between my son and my grandfather and um she watching actually my grandfather doing quite well now but she um watched him so we now have him in a day care um in hilliard oh definitely definitely i think it was more just a family preference i i preferred family um um hum um hum oh we now run on the gregorian and or that sort of thing back to your question i think you were asking are yeah that right when you re that was your question are we gonna have doom we re gonna have a catastrophe we gonna get this thing turned around before we have yes uh i think we will uh but i don think we re ready to turn around yet i think we re still well this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four five times i th uh it it is coming upon rapidly i strongly predict that in just twenty years and possibly ten each and every one of us in the world are gonna be interconnected with one another but once again its an impersonal uh inner connection i can i ll be able to contact you when you re over in paris and i ll be over ih in in ohio and out there on the farm and i am probably watching the geese swimming up and down the little lake and you re sitting over there in paris having a uh coffee something something yeah it well i i enjoy this but it it ll be impersonal because here you are i i can face you i don know whether you re really kidding me in what you re talking sitting there in the in uh street cafe or but i really do think we re gonna be interconnected in that sense and uh um it it becomes ih so much more impersonal i guess i very strong about the term personal versus impersonal inner communications um the that we ve talked about i think will be a part of that ten and twenty years from now but i think we will have begun by that time to try to clean up the act if you will uh going back to the poli political question i think that financial things who i thank think we will start we ll start slowing that down oh i think we ll have less influence uh in the terms of finance and i don think we ll get back to abraham lincoln days but uh if we can swing that pendulum back uh uh i think we i think we can and i think we will i think we can do the same thing with communications uh i think we can eliminate a of the uh bad bad influences i do know that over time what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here sort of like the definition of need versus luxury uh those definitions change the definition of socialism democracy that slowly have changed over these times well the same thing will true be true with those it still functioning excuse me um and i think we will also slowly swing that pendulum on back to the to the family again there are those doomsayer from my point of view are saying that uh in in many years to come there won be such a thing as a family uh it just you go out here you meet a an opposite sex you procri procreate and you go on your way she goes on her way and she just as satisfied about going her way as you are going your way um ye yes a lot of that is true but i think that uh i think that i don think that gonna ever happen i think we ll turn that thing around i think this so called divorce rate program as i talked about awhile ago that uh every well fifty percent of the people who marry within five years are no longer together i think that will will change and that is a very significant thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family they were supposed to do it one time and then she was supposed to give him one dose and they were giving him three doses yeah whoops that i don i didn see that part i missed the beginning and all i seen was the the chart and i was like whoa yknow that that one reason why i would hesitate to put my kid in a columbus public just like um the daycare uh i don i don think i would want my kid to go to daycare crazy a week didn like it huh oh yeah i don know about that yeah he hasn shown that period yet i don know if he supposed to be showing it now or not because um i mean when he goes to his aunt amy yknow it bye mom yknow look up okay bye that it yeah from the day one the day i left the hospital he was running around with him and he look my son whoa um hum maybe i ll move to australia i don know i mean i think it kind of ridiculous for kids to pay to chew gum yknow or if they get caught chewing it desalles my all my cousins went to desalles and if they got chot caught chewing gum they had to pay they had the paid i like what i it it a catholic school all the i was like i would not i ll chew gum when i want um like one of my friends he had um a car alarm because he had some nice stuff in his car his car alarm went off during school and he said he put his hand up and everything and told her that he needed to go outside because his car alarm was going off and um she said no you can do that on your time sit down he got all his stuff stolen out of his car it like well there that went yknow why i mean you can even have nice stuff in your car anymore i don know i don know i mean i was actually looking at that riser military and then they started popping up all this abuse stuff and i was like man darn it like my aunt his my boyfriend aunt and uncle they their their kid is has that really hyperness um a and um they do this they were trying to make it to where they he would calm down and they wouldn hafta give him so much medicine and she reads a lot of magazines and articles about yknow the problem and um i guess uh he ha uh if you change their diet if you take out milk or something i think it was did you know twizzlers had milk in them you di i oh really i was like whoa milk in twizzlers whoa um that that it like whoa milk is in and um so they change his um diet around and watch i mean they re only right now they re eating they re on a organic diet now i don know if i could afford that but um i would think it would be cheaper organic food because i mean you could actually grow that stuff but it kind of wintery now so can grow nothing right now um it kind of well i ve seen worser um so i they re doing this i think it called sit and reach where he got to sit on the floor and he got to raise his feet up just so and and he got to take his hands and reach towards his toes and he they do that for yknow like five minutes first time and they increase it and he really hates it but it it teaching him discipline responsibility you can do these things at this time yknow i yeah so he not so crazy she was doing this thing where um if he did a good job on something she would give him like a fake coin he put it in his bank and at the end of the week or something he could cash it in and get a video or a video game or something yknow that shows responsibility too but hum i think i gonna uh what i really like the riser military because it shows discipline re responsibility respect for you go to a columbus public school and the kids will lash out on substitute teachers i think it really crazy um i think you should have a lot more respect for your elders your adults so he works he he dropped out and um hum that where i come into play yknow i want to i want to be the one that has a high school i think one of us should have a high school diploma um he says he gonna probably go back and get his but it like when when do you have the time hon yknow um he works so much it like when um he a subcontractor and if uh someone got a job to do at their house he he ll do it yknow like we we just went and tore the cabinets out of a a house that was on fire and because the smoke damage so i mean carrying cabinets and he ll do it long as you re paying him he ll do it yeah i actually like a month older than him we re in the same age range i said that and he like you you wouldn i it i know right off the bat i wouldn be able to make as much money as him maybe if i do this college thing i would whack him out of the price range but um yeah uh we re yeah we re into that well i into that i into the competitive thing um but yknow yeah i i he comes home and it like will you take him and he like why i just got home i tired i like okay you sit at home with him all day okay and you go i talk to him like i would do it like i talking to you he just sitting there okay that not and he comes home you re talking to him yeah it not like you re here to talk to and he just looks at me like you are so weird and hey i ll talk to the tv like during jerry springer or something you re so wrong people look at me like okay like i sit at home all day yeah that true books reading well i think it normal to read books and stuff but yknow you re sitting there or you re like reading a magazine did you know what this guy did yknow look down at him did you see what this guy did and just looked up at you like what are you talking about he smiles at me when i talk to him so it i mean uh he he responding that a good way yeah being goofy i think later on when he gets a little older he will be yknow hey cool yknow when he can wrestle with him and all that right now he just he sits there and when he cries he goes what does he want like i know go down the list hon change his diaper or gi if he ha it been three hours since he had a bottle give him a bottle yknow play with him take him in on the kitchen floor so he can roam around because our kitchen is like open and there like nothing in it and uh yknow it like go down the list that what i do what do he just thinks i automatically know i a mind reader that what it is oh yeah okay okay good ah um hum although janet you just said yesterday that people are so overweight in columbus because there not very much to do that actually they uh what they do is they eat out all the time we it the restaurants i know it they re incredible um hum um hum wonderful restaurants uh they seem to we like to cu i do i like to cook i enjoy cooking uh just really not extraordinarily different food necessarily but just just really oh i know i like to try new recipes i do like to do that but i don think that i do a lot of real european cuisine necessarily but i i do look at recipes and enjoy eating the food too make a lot of salads i think our i don know i think it the combination plus i think the um i think the dressing is my sister recipe for dressing and it a balsamic vinegar dressing with olive oil and garlic it just a real good dressing i tend to use that most times and everything being chilled just nicely chilled and all that sort of things you do it and i do tomatoes anyhow i ll pay the extra higher price for the better ones but um hum um hum but most most of the vegetables are available truly the zucchini the um you ll find your your green peppers smaller your uh i got a um cucumber the other day and usually they re so big and i tell you i think it was that long do you oh yeah those are nice yeah they re like twi three times more price wise but they are good um hum we had um my husband and i had just some herbs you know parsley and chives and some basil rosemary that type of thing uh and you know i don think i have no small patio so do you you do that do you oh you had a harvest didn oh i know it i know it that that really what hard and now they have the little tiny grape tomatoes that are so cute haven you seen they re like they re the size of grapes yeah they re darling uh huh yeah uh huh i retired i worked for a company called highlights for children yeah yeah i was in the sales department through telephone marketing it was actual sales that i was doing i was there for fifteen years you do too i don remember exactly probably so uh huh but you re working now janet since march too yeah just since march hum she does a really wonderful job because she has a flair for interior design and so that yknow presents itself in her the way she sets everything up in the stores it very attractive um hum no right the mustiness the old yeah west broad street right oh sure yeah oh that not enough yeah and and i think it could work uh but i don think people were ready to accept it and if the people filli giving the information aren ready to accept it then it not gonna work i not sure uh i not sure that the the federal government has the ability to convince enough people to do it and i don think it i i think the people that are going to be ready to accept it and go with it are i don think you gonna get a good cross section population i think the people would be willing to understand it and go with it more if gonna be the more educated in this sort of thing then you re leaving out a large part the population so i not sure it gonna give valid results anyway period and it that a long process i mean this has been going on for two hundred years this way uh and people are suspicious of government asking questions oh yeah and you just you just send that right on over but if you don want to tell how many people live in your house right yeah see checking to see what kind of things you re ordering where you re hits are on the inter net and that just because it in the name of government they re suspicious and uh yeah it difficult you feel alone a lot of the time um and i not as liberal as i used to be uh it i think someb with age it gets tempered a little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal and it uh you know it doesn matter who i vote for they re gonna lose uh and i just stay out a lot of was interest my our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed to discuss politics and religion anything we wanted to uh but you know she stop if we got to point where we were getting physical or name calling or something like that and it was long after i left home i actually before i realized that not everybody that not everybody wants to hear your views um so i ih particularly around my in laws they re very conservative of southern ohio uh raised during the depression um in a depressed area so it i ve learned my mother in law took anytime you disagreed with her as a personal attack on her so i just learned you re not to say anything yeah uh my father in law wasn that way but my mother in law was i think i think they do who yeah my uh my brother in law was very much opposed to any kind of gun control uh the whole family was hunters hunters and things like that and now my father in law was a hunter but he was not opposed to gun control either uh as long as he could hunt and uh and they re not the kind that would go out and just shoot any animal shoot it they would use it food they sometimes they i know one time that they gave it to a family that was uh didn have any money and didn have any food they did went and killed some animals and gave it to and i don have a problem with that uh uh but my brother in law was very much opposed to any kind of gun control he he believes whatever charleton heston tells him uh i think that i they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it and pretty much all the other problems well there weren really too many other problems i mean the economy doing really and foreign relations are always shaky but they re getting a little bit better i probably vote for bush over clinton i don think that change my mind about anything i mean i don approve of his immoral behavior but it doesn change the way he runs the country i just more of a conservative person i mean i not sure exactly what his platform is but i ve seen him speak a couple and i don know he just impresses me more than al gore al gore really doesn entice me at all he claims he invented the internet all this other stuff no it probably be with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind or some kind of tax program that would probably affect my decision a little bit because i worked with a guy that was a cocaine addict for a while and he couldn have any kind of caffeine otherwise he get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills to help calm him down and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right and that type of person i don think would make a very effective president because i don know president needs to be able to think fast on their feet that would probably change my decision a little bit yeah i don think i could vote for a violent president i could vote for a president that made some mistakes with their personal life gun control i not really too interested in i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns in the street big huge guns and they re one of the safest nations in the country then you look at england they have no guns at all and they re relatively safe so i mean it more our society than the guns i believe it more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself guns should definitely be kept in a lock box where kids can get them besides that there not a whole lot that government can do it more the parents responsibility to keep the guns out of their kids hands no the worst thing that happened was a wallet got stolen out of a locker yeah pretty much here at college i really haven witnessed any violence at all i haven seen any fights i haven seen anyone get shot i mean you read about it in the lantern but the only thing that i was really shocked about was the people begging on high street yeah that really not something you see in worthington well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really doesn motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they re probably gonna stay with that because it real easy life it about the same they use drugs but not to the extreme that college students do high school marijuana acid mushrooms no error i didn know anybody in high school but in college i know some people that have used ecstasy it was more after the movie go mm hmm it was about a bunch of teenage ravers and i mean i don think a lot of people have ever heard of ecstasy until that movie kind of it like an advertisement for it yeah yeah i mean a lot of people really that i knew anyway didn know about ecstasy until they saw that movie and it was the whole talk high school whatever there were a couple that would go to raves every now and then and use it downtown abandoned warehouses that get rented out for a night they re pretty much all underground things they have a web page up i not sure what the address is right now no i ve had friends go i was gonna go to one on halloween but didn not really at parties parties are usually just mostly kegs sometimes there pot sometimes there not usually every weekend mm hmm they go to clubs they go to bars clubs um raves any place where there dancing and there lighting effects like strobe lights disco balls yeah mm hmm yeah not at all mm hmm parties didn change at all no kids just think oh it can happen to me i invincible he was recovered uh he was about thirty four years old and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but it took him a while to catch on to things yeah there a lot more in college college it seven nights a week you can go anywhere get something to drink yeah yeah mm hmm there a mild fear it seems the cops always was it what oh sometimes she and mary had more disagreements than i ever had with her she would pamper the kids and well from where we lived there we lived just off i don know whether you re acquainted with the north end of columbus but anyway indianola avenue is one of the main thoroughfares and uh we lived about a a block and a half off of indianola and then just another block was a small shopping center where there was a drug store and a sh barber shop and a a ten cent store theater i forget a couple other shops and um when orrin was about i don know five five or maybe six or seven years old he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there at all so one day grandma gave him i don know a quarter or something and that burned his pocket till i don know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or whether he went up on his own but he went up to the store and uh i think i don know whether mary went up and got him or what anyway she found out he was up there so anyh when i came home she told me what had happened and i said well that just can be so i took him downstairs and paddled him and i ve never been anything more said about it since then the only time i ever did paddle him but uh well i i told him yknow i said something we told you you are not to do and you went ahead and did it so my parents homesteaded out there in nineteen eleven or twelve shortly after they were married they they go out there and there was um i suppose it was a county seat town and they file a claim on a certain area of land uh it was surveyed off and marked off in sections a section of land is uh six hundred and forty acres and that sounds like a lot of it is a good sized area but when you can grow much of anything on it it not that valuable but they th that what they thought though you get it for free well you and then you um you prove up on it as they say you you just build buildings a house and barn and and uh so that you could live on it and uh i think i don know i suppose farm a certain amount of what i mean put in wheat or whatever and uh and after five years you get a title to it it yours so they thought well gee yknow free country free land to a farmer so uh they went out there but i dad said in the eleven years that they were out there they only raised three or four crops i mean it just too dry it wasn it wasn really farming country and he went he went out there from iowa where you throw a kernel of corn out in the field and a stalk of corn would grow but uh that how i see uh the only regular crop they had when they were out there my parents was kids there were six of us born out there and uh my oldest sister started to school out there and i don know whether my uh i don think my second sister ever went to school out there but uh things were so tough that and mom had taught school in iowa where she grew up and uh got her teacher certificate so i guess she and dad agreed that if they could find someone to stay with us kids through the day she could teach so she did i don know whether it was more than a year or not for i think it was forty dollars a month and uh course that was forty dollars more than they had otherwise and uh then i think the let see she well she went out there when bernice was going to school and bernice went to my oldest sister went to know whether it first or maybe second grade out there says she she really thought that mom was the best teacher she ever had in grade buzt uh then they hired a girl to come in as a hired girl and uh about the second or third day she was there she wasn feel wasn feeling very good she had smallpox so uh they got us kids vaccinated in time but dad didn i mean they didn get vaccinated in time and he was just covered with those sores for i don know how long uh mom said that after they started cu after the scabs started falling off of him why he get out the bed and she take the sheet out in the yard and shake it to get those scabs but uh yeah the the only uh the only people out there other than homesteaders were sheepherders there was this one guy had a so i don know how many several herds of sheep and he hire uh i think they were mexicans as sheepherders and uh they were not desirable specimens other than for heating herding sheep and we come in dirty when mom was the uh dirty as an old sheepherder and then back of our house about i don know five hundred yards there a manmade lake or a small one and i don know whether it was there when we moved there or not but anyway it was fairly good size i mean probably half mile a mile long and and out in the middle of it there was an island there been a small raised place out there and uh what i remember about it is one morning dad went out to milk and the milk cows were out on the on that island so and i don know whether he had a boat or anyway there a boat availiable to him and and he rowed across the island to milk the cows uh and then uh one day my two sisters older than i bernice and francis and i were outside playing and bernice i don know whether bernice or me but one of us said well le let let go down and wade in the lake and that was strictly no no well we started down there and francis the goody two shoes said i gonna tell mom and she did but we were out bernice had hiked up her skirts and i rolled up my pants leg and where i was probably not over knee deep but uh i think i was good talking too was all we ever got out of it right and he did that too uh no and he yknow he had he had he was living with this one family for a while um and they were nudists and taking him to nudist camps and stuff like this and i wa what do you think they would they never had any contact with us they just let him move in can you imagine letting your fourteen year friend just move in and not find out why or i just he uh he did talk to one of his friends who he wasn really a did wa didn really know that this friends mother and i grew up together uh so he was he asked if he could move into their house and the mother said there were three things one i need something in writing from your parents two i need to talk to your parents and three there are rules you ll have to obey of course that never happened i think he really does uh yknow he paying rent at his mother in law wasn not really his mother in law but in her so she can right uh he he has become more responsible but responsible about a lot of things which is again at normal maturation and he just doing it the hard way he was yknow pretty much promised a free ride through music program and he turned that and he thrown that away and i i don even know if he regrets that i really have no idea uh he just doesn want talk to us about things like that he does talk to his girlfriend about it and she become very close with my wife she never had an adult really the um a mentor of any kind even my wi she wants to go to school my wife agreed to go with her when she goes for the interviews and stuff she says she doesn know what to ask or anything and course my wife worked in higher education for thirty years so and she wants go to columbus state uh wants to get into one of their engineering tech programs um um hum and i i hope she does um ca she be she never fit in in high school she is very bright she mature in so many ways but she had to be responsible for herself her whole life um but she was never interested in and never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or uh make up and clothes and things like that and yknow yo you you re setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that and that what happened she come home in tears because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple months she got her may be kind of hard in a when she gets into a engineering tech program because she hasn had all a the math prerequisites because she just didn stay in school long enough i i think she yeah she will and she she and she very determined uh she has said that ha having this being pregnant having this baby has made her focus on things a lot differently she doe doesn she doesn wanna go back to being the way she was before she doesn want go back to the the drugs and the smoking and the drinking hu everyth uh th all focus changes it really does and it never goes back to the way it was before did you just know that there someone that completely dependent on you for everything everything you do right right and she taken very good care of herself she followed all the doctor uh orders and she very careful what she eats and and they ve met the couple that gonna adopt the baby which seems kind of odd to me but uh right and th they were actually able to select the couple from a they talked to a lawyer who arranges adoptions and she had a file and they yknow threw kind of a bunch of questions and answers type thing were to limit to th down to three couples and they liked the first couple they met so right but uh you know with people coming back later and saying that uh they di changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents i be concerned about that but that not gonna happen in this case i don think and the because of her age and this makes no sense to me the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for adoption uh because of her age and it doesn make any sense to me but so the yknow they re talking to a social worker now to find out they don want take the baby home because they re afraid of being too attached to it then and they don think it a good for it because her mother smokes constantly her mother alcoholic um they no uh so she does not want to take the baby home so they re arranging some other things we have actually talked about taking the baby home ourselves for that time but we think that gonna be too hard for us we even talked about adopting the baby but at our age that i mean we be seventy years old when the kid graduates from high school uh and that wouldn be fair to the kid an and we were doing it for the wrong reasons too so we talked about it decided it wasn a good idea i not sure i ready to go back through all as much fun as it was the first time uh i just not ready willing to do that again it a great experience it really i wa i wa even when yknow we were having problems with him and stuff it was great uh he couldn understand yknow my wife once said told him she says yknow something about spending time together she she said that there is no time that we spend with you that wasted and he couldn understand that she said you mean this is fun i said i didn say it was fun ju it just not and uh i don think he really understood that he might someday but yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we re not ready she be she been very mature about it uh and she has they are working on an arrangement with the uh couple that are adopting baby will get counseling for her afterwards too and that one things they ve asked for in the adoption agreement and the couple willing to do that oh yeah i right and yknow th while the baby in the hospital be covered under my son insurance and she covered under her father insurance so their medical expenses are not gonna be very big so now they have different art classes and different speech and uh language classes different levels of science and it kind of like a college campus it just like a miniature version of ohio state yeah you go to you go to class in one building and you go across the yard to another then you go to lunch and then you come across another and your locker and all that stuff it just like a mini campus not really the there were too many rules there well you only had to be at your locker at a designated time and some of the teachers actually had the right to search your bags and book bags i mean when it gets to that then yeah there there been teachers there that actually pull students aside if they know they re troublemakers and say well you can come down here yknow go to your locker at this time or whatever yeah it is it it it yeah it is a really disciplined school but it lot of rebellion in it the same time like there be kids saying yes ma am yes ma am yes ma am in class and then they re out there smoking at the cars or cutting school and high on their horse yeah some of them are too hum i wasn there that long no actually i was uh going to get my after that because they kicked me out for some dumb reason they confused me with somebody else and i ended up taking the blame well the charge was cutting class yeah and what it was i was supposed to meet my mom outside i told my teacher i brought a note and got a excuse slip and all that i went down to my locker before and the teacher we called her the general because she would always be out there watching you not a teacher but administrator excuse me and she was out there and she saw me at my locker and what are you doing down here and the whole thirty minute conversation that could ve only lasted five minutes with thank you okay here my slip she thought i forged the slip and then when i went out there she had uh security remove me off the premises that following monday because i was supposed to go out and sign something for a lease didn really happen that way i went and signed it and i came back school monday thinking yeah well another day another dollar whatever get there and they go ahead and out door what no it just uh regular old rent a cop with his own van he hop in i ll give you a ride and drove me to the corner of the middle of nowhere in accordance to where i live and then i had to walk all the way home well i was a little bit on the pissed side yeah i i did i did my bitching but really wasn nothing to do about it because yknow once they have their word in it they re better than us i guess she didn she didn say anything i mean they wouldn let her i mean we went in there one day and yknow i explained the whole thing to her and and then she puts off some kind of excuse the administrator she says well we don need problem students like yourself blah blah blah i said what problem i going out there like this and a freaking retards i swear but there is kids out there always cutting yknow at lunch time they be cutting their next class yknow there two different lunch times sometimes they just alternate and take two lunches or go to one class go to one lunch and skip after then but i you man they wouldn cut me slack for nothing yeah yeah and then uh i went to work before that yeah i just i had to walk from hilliard one day through matter fact through this twelfth avenue stretch right there all the way over to eleventh avenue man that was that was a hot day too um hum i just got done doing some roofing and i was supposta meet my girlfriend out there she never did show up so i had to walk from incredibly where incredible universe useta be we ll just say hilliard and two seventy all the way back this way on campus without water oh man talk about being stuck in a desert yeah that was after i got kicked out and i just decided i ll go to wurk work for couple months make something out of it i learned a trade man stressful older you get more stressful it gets mean i remember when i was seventeen and i was yknow out having my good old fun and taking care of things yeah exactly so yknow once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that pretty much why we moved because i had a lot of frustration built up what next got a whole list there i don know anything about the stock oh man don let the shirt fool you oh man i wish i knew what the buy this i need a grocery list to find out what we need to buy yeah well you get these you probably heard on the news these uh fifteen murders or so since nineteen ninety one on the east side and then you got all these people yknow i ve been in a fights in my neighborhood and well my old neighborhood and yknow fights people breaking in stealing your stuff and just all out outlandish behavior mean i caught i actually rode up on a couple people down the street from me having sex through a fence i sorry yes i thought i would expect that from dogs i mean yeah a dog can probably get away with that kind of stuff but in broad daylight and i was only about fifteen years old i going like what the hell is this what going on i mean i didn know who was president then but i knew that there was couple people it just columbus is getting too big for what it is mean that why you have high crime rate high population population number one and uh i say pretty soon if they don cage it up a little bit yknow just have enough residence for the area instead of people being homeless and yknow jobless everything like that i mean i hear in new york city where it a lot more populated it uh getting real bad of course you probably know about that well muggings on the subway or stuff yknow just in general yeah very well and yknow her vocabulary limited and she didn know how to spell or know any bigger words so i tried to sit her down and yknow give her a little refresher and yknow it coming from a new jersey public school and doing a study then yknow couple these different places you never even hear of like i don know cow pow kentucky or wherever you want it yknow some small town would have this great teaching no and other towns just don not really national system it already been put to national if they rate them state to state and city to city but on on the level of the actual needs of the student yknow you can just put down yknow a book and say i want you to put five hundred words on this page why you like this or dislike this book i mean one person can do it and another one mean you could probably write about thousand words on a page right now about psychology because of your how many years do you have two three yeah okay so you re you re higher up there than i would be when your come in uh all right that about same time my friend got hers yeah she went down to western missouri yeah just had to leave me here we ve been best friends for so many years oh hell yeah look at you you hoosier yeah so uh things pretty much in columbus public schools yknow they don they don actually sit down with you they automatically assume that once you get to this level you re ready for this level and you go on well the a and the yknow just all those centralized scoring systems they have they th they pretty much told me that yknow my scores when i was in what was it fifth grade yeah fifth grade they said that i was i had a high i and i could be doctor lawyer ya da ya ya da i don trying to raise my hopes up about it but then they had this other kid who was actually really into veterinary medicine and flying helicopters and all that and he really did go on to uh study about that myself cook but well they pretty much put by the test scores they don sit you down like in private schools they do this they sit you down one to one just like we are and they spend probably yknow maybe twenty thirty minutes a day actually getting to know the student what the student still needs for the completion of that grade and once they ve figured that you re able to go there then up you go right up the ladder no it it kind of like um you go to a private school and you get there maybe seven years old on up to fifteen sixteen and at sixteen they can actually determine give you a test and sit down with you and ask you about different things and sixteen fifteen sixteen year old could actually graduate from college yknow be yeah they ve sh they ve showed that study already i mean i think it i think it amazing yeah i mean when i first heard about it i said uh some doogie howser shit yknow but now it just yknow now it kind of reality yknow because i know pretty much a lot of skilled skilled trades i know how to cook pretty much know how to handle myself out in the wilderness mean yknow go up on nature hikes and go fishing all that stuff just combines into one it all about being an individual and if those teachers can study with that individual know what that individual wants young then older kids not gonna know what to do end up practicing law and not liking it going to all that school for it fort hayes yeah well i don i don think it really alternative it supposed to be a uh let me see school for art short north it in the short north but um it so much fun it absolutely so much fun because it really weird um you normally don get hit on by girls when you go to a regular dance club but when you go to axis you don get hit on by girls you get hit on by guys i danced with glow sticks and i ve had i had like seven guys come up to me in one night and they re just like can can you like can you do that for me because apparently they apparently they get really fascinated by the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i do that for i do it right in front of their face and they be like dude that dude that and apparently that a way of inishing a conversation um one of the guys that i usually go clubbing with he the one that got me into the glow stick dancing and he said uh he said it like a sign that says hit on me and i like oh great that that just what i need no it doesn bother me doesn bother me i just i just i sort of just i just like not yknow i straight if they start if they start getting really yknow really pushy about it i just like i straight but a lot of times it really funny because i ll get in a conversation with em and they ll be like you re straight aren you i like yeah they ll yeah they i don know how but they must they it just being i must guess it must be the way i talk or or or something but i think i keep a lot of them away because i do a lot of really i do a lot of really robust movements with my glow sticks i like flailing about and yknow it like this i got this wide berth around me yeah it it not one of these it one of these and yeah it yeah um hum hum yeah yeah i guess i just so secure about who i am that i don have a problem with it and i was in the men glee club for a while so there a small percentage of the people in there that are yknow that a that are gay as well and that and and i really made friends with a lot of them i guess uh i mean i guess it just because of my personality i i re i really don know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey you can be my friend i cool i all right even though i not even though i not one of you i can still be your friend which is sort of what i try and emanate because i i very very religious and it the christian community is very is i not gonna say can be i say they are christian community is very very mean towards homosexuals and so that just not right i mean they re people they re making a mistake in in my eyes yes but that doesn mean i going look at them any differently as human beings they deserve my respect oh yeah but i see everyone as engaging in sinful behavior because in my in my religion everyone sins um i a i a christian i go to a non denominational church yeah i don like denominations i not i not real big on the denominations because i think that i think that sort of goes against what the original intent of of christianity was i i mean it was designed to be a unifying religion and the denominations there are just are are just yeah but if i don like them um hum um hum yeah um hum yep not really i mean i have i i there theological differences that i have um without going into too much detail um one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to columbus and i found an amazing church down here and learned a lot and and really stumbled across a lot of interesting doctrine and theological beliefs and i believe that stuff now and he doesn and he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is like a heretic and he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i didn want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were im ing each other and uh he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and i told him yknow i like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about uh yknow talked about not liking i believe and i sai and i told him i said i can i can understand if in our minds there a problem but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong and leave it at that but that not what you re thinking you re thinking you re looking at me and you re knowing within your mind he evil he wrong and i said that not right dude i i honestly don know uh people get really scared there certain i mean like i it there certain denominations that will take one it sort of like the outer limits they ll take one book or one scripture out of the bible and expand it to crystal clarity and they ll just run with it and that what my mom came out of um her her denomination that she came out of she not part of it any more denomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apostolic christian church we re talking men sit on one side women sit on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry the sermon is read in three different languages some really wacky stuff i mean some really wacky they ll just take one scripture and they ll expand it um and and they ll just run with that one scripture and then there are also churches that will just deletes and they ll in the in mi in their minds they ll delete certain sections of the scripture that they don like first corinthians chapter twelve talks about um spiritual gifts and that one of the big things that i into down here in columbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and spiritual gifts like healing people and and um the extremely taboo um religious topic among a lot of churches is the gift of tongues whether it dead whether it not whether it inspired whether it not inspired yadda yadda blah blah well i hadn even heard about it until i got to columbus because and and i know the bible pretty well and i hadn even heard about it until i got to columbus and i get to columbus and i like okay this is pretty cool i went home and i talking to some people in my parents church and they re like oh yeah um we just don really talk about that very often and i just why i mean it part of the scripture that you say you believe in a hundred percent then why don you why don you talk about it and the problem is that they don they don know the answer and if they don know the answer if they can give a firm this is the answer then they avoid it try and find it i try and find for me what has become the best answer yknow if i don if i don bel if i don believe something or i don know what to believe about something i ll go and i ll find an answer for myself i not gonna take somebody else answer and if i do take someone else answer they better be able to back it up yknow yeah yeah yeah yeah well i know a lot of people that do but i know a lot of people that don um hum um hum um do the theological discussions no no unless unless you re seeking that out i mean i go to the vineyard church it up in it up in uh um westerville and there about there about probably six thousand of us it one the biggest churches in ohio and um but if you want to find something in that church you can find it you can find a discussion group about anything it just a matter of finding it and within any within any denomination or within any religion you go as deep as you want to go yknow there are people that just go on sunday mornings there are people who just go on easter there are people who go monday wednesday tuesday and then sunday nights and saturday nights and are very very very into that and i mean i not the monday tuesday wednesday thursday type but i am pretty involved i pretty involved um hum the community the community um the church is designed as a community of other christians it not necessarily designed as um i heard this in a sermon this is really good um it not designed as the congregation comes in and says way to go pastor you go do it we re gonna cheer you on the job of a christian is to go out and spread the gospel of jesus christ that the job of a christian and there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that what the original yknow that what the that what a christian supposed to do and that what our church does it weird i i wish they would make it i don wanna say fr well i think they do make it free um and i hate to say it but a little bit easier access um because i don think it ll cause people to have more sex i think they re gonna have it anyhow so it would only be better and safer for them yeah um hum um hum the shot okay um hum okay um hum um hum yknow we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i not in for the yknow george orwell nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all um my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and who not but i don think god gonna come down and do that so well yknow what i we can really decide that but to be honest i for it um it doesn have to be well i not even sure tubes tied is is pretty permanent um but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year that still not still much cheaper than them having kids um and then if they would i give more money if they clean up their act just for them um as far as it being racist i don think i think they re missing the the point because i sure there some runaway white teenage girls out there too or mexican or what not um think the point is they re on drugs yknow and i don yeah i not i don consider myself racist at all it is that that what happening but it just one of those things that you hate to say yeah i for it because you sound like it like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt yknow and i kind of look at it that way there enough kids out there that need love and you don yeah yeah um hum yeah um hum yeah yeah which cracks me up because if you ve ever looked at the parents of models they re not necessarily all that yeah that yeah yeah yeah i know yeah i do too um hum um not to sound like a broken record but i really think it our uh backslide on on family units i think it too easy to stay i and i ve been married and divorced so i ve unfortunately had that experience to me um that it too easy to get divorced um people don really go into marriage with commitment and lifetime and have that i don wanna say old fashioned values but just the value of this is very important um because lets face it to to me love is a choice because there times when i don love my husband i wanna smack him and he being a little barney but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes and lo and behold an hour later week later what ha whatever long takes i in love with him again i mean really yknow what i saying and um i think it just too easy to get divorced i don believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of a just children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment um unfortunately i think that the problem parents um are a either getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other yknow using the kid as a medium um or they re too selfish and don listen to their kids or they didn i i don wanna say selfish but lets face it like we said yknow even having a dog takes some time out of your your your schedule and um not spend enough time with the kids yknow they re working what not and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them and let them grow and things like that uh and i don think enough families are doing that um i think ih uh some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely um you do go through a period in your life where you don feel like you have any friends or you feel totally different i mean i still through that i think we all go through that at some point or other even yearly for some of us um so i just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he cause because using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and didn have that blind eye i think that part of your responsibility as a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrongdoing in your child eyes you need to really admit it um i mean you don wanna do that but yeah yeah and his mom even signed for stuff i think yeah i mean yknow signing oh here you go hun um the one i think is pretty obvious that the blind eye was something that shouldn have happened the other one that yeah you just let face it at that age and at every age we want a leader um and i guess it goes back if we choose to or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we ll make better decisions of who gonna lead us so i don know i really the i think a lot of it the family unit breaking down in general yknow and secondly i think to be honest i think the media gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it um and i do think yknow they know they re gonna get recognized they re gonna have their name go down in history unfortunately um i think that has something to do with it too um it frustrating to turn on the news they don really cover my husband comes from a journalistic background and he ll be like that not news yknow what i mean it just we get so ah let sit here and watch a plane crash for twelve hours instead of watching i don know what little house on the prairie i don know i being facetious but yknow what i oh yeah right right and just going over it and over it and over it then you get the shooting out in honolulu and the next day there another one it just kind of like that syndrome yknow well at least i can be popular for fifteen minutes or whatever um i mean i not saying not to cover it but yeah and then course you have the whole gun control stuff that just ridiculous um i think they might have tried any how but obviously they wouldn have been as uh good at it or yknow what i trying to say it wouldn have been as much distraction because obviously the bombs is something but to actually have that right there i mean have the access and what not i mean i guess the grandparents had the house locked and they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew th how to use them and uh that scares me ell all the kids in the world who that that will happen through that bad influence all the kids yknow and they re like wow let do this too we can make school yknow let out for a little bit i they might not be doing it to um cause any harm but yknow yes for attention and uh yeah were crazy yeah yeah i bet you i i sure those kids probably had problems because i i mean i was like the very i was a very depressed kid too when i was teenager like always wanted to kill myself and stuff yknow i just maybe i not sure because i don know how there parents were it could have been it could have been the people they were hanging around they yknow i mean i think they could try if their ya their kids try and push them away they shouldn yknow let their kids push them away yknow i guess you can make your kid go out with you and do things they want stay in their room i know i don know but i would know there was something going on with my kid and i would definitely keep a eye out and yknow figure out what going on yknow i know see i would be all up in the room too looking see what he reading i i would have be just like my mother was even even though hated it but i would i would do that yep yep yep she read my notes and all that i i don know i don remember yep ok so that basically what we ve been doing we ve been progressing for fifteen years and um i proud to say that our state agency is probably the only agency other than maybe this highway patrol we work a lot with them but i think our we re the only ones that have their own wiring cable people and the administrators for telecommunications for the state of ohio are working with us as observers because they don have a staff and um it it great we ve been reengineered last eight years dot downsizing and trying to fit the uh uh fit the i guess the attributes the person brings to work as opposed to not one of the problems i i see as an as an employer or as a supervisor manager a lot of times we have to promote because well the bureaucracy says you have to do this in order to get up there they don take in consideration the attributes the person and so now we re saying okay if you bring this attribute to the table and you can help the team then why not reward instead of putting you over here in let say a position which you really don have any for but you re there because the money only okay so we re trying to fit the attribute to the person compensate them accordingly which hey if i think we did that we probably have more teachers um but the thr trouble is we don fit the horse with the proper carriage load and we need to do that in our society we need to work as a there no sense in having thr having five guards on a basketball team if you don have a center that can tip it off and rebound but we go out and look uh we look do it differently in sports but we do this differently in the the uh secular world we should look at it as as a sport oh and that that a problem in our society and if if something can come out of the university here to the reverse of that i think you have a lot less psychological problems with people and domestic problems work problems everything because the problem comes down to the fact well gee it not it not recognized yknow were trends in our society that say well you gotta be a you gotta be a computer guru you gotta be thi well before before gates was recognized he was nothing to our society now we he we bow to him but what tell what does it tell us about our people we re so we ve got to look inside ourselves and say what can we bring to society that that that can be more beneficial and most the time it listening not for long you consider the housing trends and there there again that goes back to the stupid consumer i say stupid consumer because when i was in college i always said well fourth consumer had a fourth grade education level and how how many dollars does a consumer put in to research as opposed to the business that the inequity in our life you re you re basically putting the shaft to the consumer and until that consumer becomes on equal knowledge level as the mark it always gonna be inequitable and you re gonna have a problem in our society because we don need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age it becomes a liability but then the developers are thinking well let see well we can make downsize a little bit but still we want make this we want make this margin of yeah we do but what about for society best interests well you used a word earlier in your statement what we we should buy yeah the retailer what we should buy and that the we listen to business too if business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves but you can you also grow with you can work with the community and still gain the respect from community and you ll have allegiance but yknow nowadays we don have any loy loyalty at all it out the window uh and that what i fear the most you re saying the internet yeah big deal you re going after what you want well maybe some people want low cost they don want service okay boom disposable that the problem we have in our society today because of one thing we re trying communi communicate as you say through the internet and through businesses but we don have and we don have commitment without those you ll never have success well i think it starts with the family but the problem is in the last thirty years we ve emphasized uh not i shouldn say thirty years post world war two post world war two is where we broke the family up and let me tell you how i i analyze this during world war two we took the little lady out of the house and said hey we need you on the production lines making war machineries so be it yknow we had the out there helping out the the i fine team effort wasn it but then after i came home the little lady went back in to the house and business all these idle lines say hey we can do something here because in those days the little lady said well i ll go out and get a little odd job uh we want a little thing mom would do pick up a little extra things here and so forth dad was a pr primary breadwinner but she go out and do some odd jobs just to compliment their needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit and now i mean i jumping ahead of myself here but business said hey let produce these lines little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it now it comes back to your statement what do they us we need well now well gee uw you need a refrigerator you need frost free you need all these things and you know you go down the street and see how many garage sales you have and then you ask people why you buy them we thought we needed them see it again the business out foxed the consumer basically you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another trying to understand your neighbor and spending time giving quality time for understanding the intangibles of life tangibles depreciate and they will depreciate and will be nothing and your investments gone but you to you you had to work you had to you had to migrate they they started separating the family up by saying sir if you want a job we re expanding to los angeles we re sah so they split the family up okay fine and the family probably said okay we re we want you to get advancement we want your good will the problem is you ran up a culture differences culture differences over here and so forth and then we became a little more uh promiscuous and i said well gee yknow mom dad and so forth they don know what going on out here on the west coast with us yknow and so forth they think everything is going okay because we didn have communication as and then all of a sudden you find out and usually mom found out she is something doesn sound right through the airways or to the writing something mysterious going on here and you find out they were doin having difficulties well divorce became acceptable before it was a no now it acceptable and then you had uh the celebrities becoming more notable we don we don ih we don get married anymore no okay then we had the idea of doing away with gold metallic the metallic backing i think it was was the one that did that and said we ll just uh print promissory notes and so now we keep we we buy ourselves out every dilemma in the saying well hey we ll just pay you we pay you more country then fine but every time they print more it makes the money in your pur investment but hey who cares huh that what they kept promoting and then all of a sudden about nineties they came around say hey you know what our cre our deficit is going the other way we re we re going way out of whack on this thing that because you ve been spending more consumers are doing the same thing they haven learned that mom and dad remember mom went out and got a little piece as a time that they needed things no i want the whole house completely furnished i want the cars we don talk about buying cars nowadays we talk about leasing cars and pretty soon we re not going be buying houses we ll be leasing houses from the finance companies we won be owning a land the finance company own belgium is it own country i don know where i going to fly into honestly i ih doing a courier flight mm hmm mm hmm town with the chunnel take the ferry from southeastt london prague czech republic budapest that the optimism yeah okay i have now dover and ferry what else do i need to remember okay now i have bruge ferry to i sorry dover ferry to bruge belgium and then train at that point i gi to activate my eurail pass i teach a class on thursday nights how to play with computers um play games on tuesday nights i don know we vary it from one week to the next um role playing games under whatever system popular that day card games not usually fifty two card deck cards but other interesting types of cards or board games or just anything that happens to appeal is a group of five guys who know each other no some of them play at game stores i done it once and said eh it wasn that good and continue merrily on with my day there you go i had enough friends who said to me can you make money with computers i said yes you can make oney with computers and i said what could i with computers then i finally just said okay training people to make money with computers so none of these would well no some of these people would know what ebay is but probably only one or two out of like six so what we re talking an extraordinarily low level understanding of what computers are how they work so class one was demystifying the computer we took it apart we labeled everything inside i gave them all a piece i said put it back together we turned it on we saw if it worked we went back in figured out why it didn work took it apart again this wasn something can do hardware because hardware has no money in it but um it was so that they re not scared of the magic box and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scared of the magic box and could continue to operating systems the goal of learning operating systems is real simple if you re playing with computer and you screw something up the worst thing you can possibly do is screw it up so badly that you have to start over starting over means putting a new operating system on it anything else is a hardware failure and you have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they re going to break something so once you convince people that there nothing ne be scared of here and there nothing to be scared of there i mean and then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning if you can play you won learn you just sit there and follow my directions and that dumb most of them are still sadly just sitting there and following my directions but they re getting better weekends i usually try and keep free so that i can make stuff up and uh i don because of the usually the the one night a week that isn horribly well scheduled wednesday nights are preparing for travel and you told me not to this that trying stick to that sorry friday nights are date night because i become unpopular if i have like any time away from my girlfriend the more time i have away fram no no uh this is sherry so i spend time away from sharon i become unpopular and if i continue to do that for a long for long period time i become very unpopular so to that end we have a designated friday evening date night sherry usually tries to get all of saturday and all of sunday as date night as well sort of like an extended date weekend thing this is a game we play every weekend it it okay game monday night i usually come up with something dumb that needs to occur this was something that i would have done on a monday night for whatever reason yeah yeah girlfriend works for hell also known as ameritech yes center of all things evil in the world who would you go with and the other one is mcdonald yeah uh she in my class yes yes no no my i was born in new york i wasn playing then went to tennessee with my family that was

experiences but as it stands they re just weird so i drifting now you will hear me way too much was interested in going out to and i been out there several times but ooh it uh why wasn i not interested in moving out with my mother at the same time no now it on my chin get off my chin at the same time that my mother and my dad split up i was just about to start my second year at worthington high school so i about to start my sophomore year for the first time in like three years i at this school for two years in a row and so i was like no i i just finally made friends there no way in i um my father and i always noise error whining so my father and i i gonna start getting phone calls here in a little bit i ll just postpone so my father and i always for the third time understood each other much better then my mother and i did we were able to communicate in a very similar fashions we didn always agree in fact i am probably more diametrically opposed to him than anybody else i ever got to play with but at least he understood what was going on from one moment to the next and so it was kind of a no brainer it was like all my friends and somebody who understands that i wanted them to file charges on him and they said well no uh he not met the criteria i said well he doesn get to school sometimes until lunchtime they said well he gets here just in time to not be counted um tardy or not tardy but absent for the whole day which would co be considered truant so they said i well i had to do was go down to juvenile to this certain gentleman in juvenile and have him file charges so i took my son down to him and he said it was the school should have did that so in the meantime he telling me that my son in getting ready to go eleventh grade and neither side gonna do anything about it somebody should ve did something about that because then yknow they would have been doing what they were supposed to do to make him yknow get in line and uh so he knew he could get by with it he that goes with the disorder they know they know when who button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and yknow where the line is and they push you always that why teachers they uh they drive the teacher up the wall yknow my daughter yknow there was just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i call up to the school and yknow the principal like he he say miss yknow i i am her last chance yknow my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he like mrs yknow she like yknow the average student uh she the type yknow that she gonna get yknow she got gonna get through college yknow she just one of those yknow that just moves right along yknow she not the brightest yknow but she bright enough and those are your average professional people out working today and i was just like well i just want more help for my daughter yknow i just want somebody to yknow jerk her down but they wouldn yknow because my daughter was like um real bubbly outgoing yknow people person and she got by with so much at school and she yknow worked it worked out fine with her with both of them actually well her major is communications it didn start out that but my daughter wants to write books okay well in the meantime yknow you gotta pay the bills so i yknow i not sure what she wants to do she had so many different kinds of jobs part time jobs though hum yknow i when she was younger like ten years ago she wanted to have her own talk show yeah so i don know she getting a second child now it getting a little harder yknow i do hope that she does she is a good writer i do hope that yknow someday she can be able to do that yeah she just likes to write stories and she real creative that way and the baby is due may thirtieth and graduation is june second so however this works out yknow i don know i just i just like okay she just does i just want to get it over with and see now she yknow yeah she just wants to get it over with yeah so she said she gonna be catching the disability bus out here yknow after a certain amount of time she gonna ride that bus is it oh that a good day yeah course yknow babies tend not to be on on time so yeah my kids were both two two weeks late so i know how it is yeah it it interesting too because when she had her other child uh her she had made arrange she was at uh otterbein then she made arrangements that uh she might have to be in the hospital taking a final with one of her teachers so that baby was born in march so i think she got the finals right in or yknow it just too much stress for me to even think about so that why she trying to get it out of the way now because yknow the the the husband he makes yknow fairly decent money so yknow she doesn have to work right now but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up yknow after the baby comes she will need to work i have custody of another grandchild uh my son when he was in high school had a girl no a little girlfriend and she was uh see he was tenth grade and she was ninth grade i guess she uh had a baby and uh believe my son was in eleventh grade when the baby was born and uh she had a lot of problems running away from home and uh she uh yknow well my son left to move into the dorm here at and she uh moved in with me i think the baby was fifteen months old and i tried to help the young lady and it just turned out that the yknow the young lady was not ready to be a mother my son wouldn even now isn ready to be a father so uh there was a yknow whole investigation through childrens services and uh they gave me custody of the child temporarily and she still there and she four and a half the mother married and has another child now and and the the little one still with me she hasn tried to get her daughter back she has visitation with her i love her very very much yknow that way emotionally but boy i like for her mom to take her back yeah yknow i fortunate because i got a grant for her through the uh a at a very nice um learning center that she goes to everyday so yknow course a lot of that yknow hinges on the fact that my son is a student and they re very pro education yknow so my son he back home now but i wish he would go too he just joined this fraternity oh my gosh it was a it was it was just unbelievable he got really sick after that rush week yeah really sick so they want him to move in the fraternity house he can really afford it but they just sent me a really nice letter saying he like in the top of their chapter academically and everything so i thinking they might help him out a little bit they want him in the house real bad yeah yeah i i was really glad that my son uh met yknow was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because uh yknow the guys are real real nice yknow very it very yknow he always kind of been like real stand off ish when it comes to yknow hooking up real tight with guys but he really likes these guys thirty on it and his report card he got like a one point two five average so they take jalena who has an a him who has a and they go well gee the average kid in the school is like plus and they re stupid at this school columbus public schools don do any good then you go to dublin worthington westerville in order to get there you you re not gonna be in his condition and you re not gonna be stupid because you re trying to yknow you probably both husband and wife work so the intelligence is there and you re not gonna have dumb people living and going to those schools because it very expensive live in that area so there a natural prejudice that columbus is stupid and worthington dublin and it really not true it just that yknow you can tell all the poor people and the people that don have two parents don come to school because we want our scores higher but yknow when the and when the news media goes look how bad brown school did this year but they don look to see like jalena they don go well look at the uh scores on the california achievement tests there like seventy five percent the kids that are getting like yknow nineties and above but twenty five percent are getting and so it brings that do and it uh like yknow they re they re not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the test at both schools i ll bet you they re all about the same because like i think it archie griffin that went to a really crummy school in uh in in columbus and to me no matter how bad of an area you live in and and ba bad a bad a school you think you re going to if you want to do it you can because it and really in columbus public schools if you have a learning disability or yknow if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is a psychologist or a tutor or something to help you and and in uh like worthington and westerville dublin yknow they don have the money to throw away and like catholic schools they don have the money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get pushed aside and so yknow as you can see i standing on my soapbox here i do like columbus public schools but yknow i i i hate when people say yknow look at these test scores because it really doesn reflect what there because it like saying all kids carry guns to school they don yknow and the media says well what has there been like maybe five or six people who have taken guns to school and killed people well what about the uh millions and millions of kids that go to school every day do their homework and yknow do community service and stuff well well well that just to boring we don want to hear that stuff yknow it like that that irritates me oh there we go um hum um hum right um hum right um hum uh they really have no self worth because yknow uh i uh i know a long time ago uh we went to a um uh what was tha it like a a seminar for the ivy league schools which i looked at the tuition and went yknow there was no way but and i thought this is so stupid to be here but i listened to the man the there there was like four or five men talking and some women talking whatever and uh they said yknow if your if your child makes straight a and uh applies at our school we don want them and i like what he says uh he says we look at two two children sitting side by side this one making straight a this one sort of made but this one over here got into track when he or she was in freshman and and we noticed every track meet they basically wa were like last or second to last but they did it for four years then they yeah and and never got any better then they got in marching band and they were in that for four years and sometimes we notice they marched and sometimes they didn because they didn learn their music but they stayed with it and they said then they like volunteered down at cosi they didn get paid a dime for this but they did it because they enjoyed helping and definite so like they go we want that student over there said you as a straight a student have proved nothing to us and you over there as a student have proved that by gosh yknow you ll try out for something and if you don do well you go but i like doing it and i gonna keep with it yknow and to me the straight a student who does nothing is like the kids who go to school and shoot people they have nothing in their life at all and the other one has yknow activities and they re giving of themselves to the community yknow yknow like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library reading program and then they went on and they volunteer at cosi and and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like easter egg hunts for the school is a grade school and it attached to co columbus alternative high school so um yknow i re i read an um uh a uh resume that she put in for a scholarship and it was explaining how the the closest she got to crying at school was when she would uh do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy and i it was just they were just so excited that the kids went out and bought like a dollar or twos worth of candy and hid it out and they have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says yknow those and things that were important to her and yknow to me that makes you feel like you re worth something but the kids that go yknow the ones who went to school i yknow i don see any community service or i don know about i i not a big gung ho have to be religious person i mean i i feel i a christian but i not a church goer and i don think you hafta go there to be a religious person yknow but uh yknow i think religion and community service and feeling like you have given something to the community and yknow you re just not asking continuously for it yknow and and trying things and failing at them and going okay well but i still like to play basketball i terrible but i like to play and i can make the team so what do i do i know i ll go to the and play there yknow that that what keeps kids out of trouble and those that go to school and come home and either sit on the computer and yknow what do the chat room stuff or the mail stuff or sit on the playing with video games i think those the ones that are the big problem children because they yknow mom and dad go how can i get them to do something and stay out of my hair oh i know i ll buy them a nintendo i ll buy them this sega i ll buy this look they re out of my way yknow because yknow oh yeah and and i i ll probably step on your toes here but i i not a firm believer of mom and dad both working i my wife worked until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was home and yknow my parents didn do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself every day there was nobody there to talk to yknow and i did it for years and and i just feel that yknow i i hope you don have children yet do you good because to me parents who put kids in daycare and uh yknow after school programs are like people who have cats and dogs i get up in the morning and i feed my pet my child then i put him in the kennel and i go to work and i go gee i like to go for some drinks after work or go to a movie we ll just put her in another kennel after work and we take her from one kennel to the other kennel we go we ll be back a little bit and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off and feed her and i go don bother me i ve had a bad day and i tired you go watch and how are we raising children doing that yknow yknow and people say uh you hafta have both those incomes because we hafta do this i go well why do you hafta have a house that three hundred thousand dollars why do you have have a brand new car yknow isn life sacrifices a aren aren you supposed to like do best for your children yknow i mean i my children don have everything they don have a sega yknow my daughter has a car that goes to and it twelve years old yknow and i made her buy it i told her i says i will not buy you a car i said if you want a car you hafta buy it and i said when it time for maintenance you have to pay for it because she has to be responsible for things and she appreciates that yknow and yknow i admire her i mean she the person i never was that age yknow but yknow and i i don take full responsibility for that but i very proud of the way her and her sister are but i just think it because mom was home and yknow there was somebody there to listen to them and it doesn have to be mom i mean um yknow mom can go work and dad can stay home there nothing wrong with that either but i just think they need mom or dad there everyday when they come home so they know when they come home and they ve had a really bad day and something really bothering them they can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours and letting it kind of fade away and then when everybody comes home it like well how how school okay yknow anything bothering you no yknow so oh there we go okay um hum yeah well you re very smart yknow to some extent yeah but to some extent no because see when i was in the service it was a different time uh well take for one thing when i was overseas if we wanted to do something we wait till sergeant went the shed and we just put a padlock on the door so he couldn get out and then we go do what we wanted to do yknow because when you re overseas it a different environment people are more scared of you than you are of them especially if you re waiting to go into combat because you gotta trust the people you re around you don really wanna piss them off excuse me but you know what i mean and there a lot of alcoholics in the military when i was in there yeah and most the time they re putting them in charge well like we get no offense we get these college students coming out that were second lieutenants that thought they know everything and some of them did and some of them were just complete idiots but you find that anywhere so you took your good for your bad i got a lot of respect for the college kids majority of them it it other people i don have for well like management here well like i getting ready to go through layoffs again where i work at but yet they got people we had no manager say for three months so course they took somebody that they were gonna lay off put them in a management position they re making eighty thousand dollars a year the can see nothing wrong with that but yet they won lay off people that actually need the jobs so the way the university here is run i can agree with most stuff they do like i said i ve been here twenty five years i ve seen a lot of weird stuff fact is was at baker i seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years yet paid every week for doing nothing yeah yeah it ain gonna change though i just an operator right now i ve done production work too for them but basically i went back in operations because it not the money i like the job just mount tapes uh do printouts monitor systems uh people have problems help solve them just different stuff it different every day that why i like it just like you talking to people it different every day and i don like sitting in an office uh i did when i worked at the hospital i worked at the hospital here over here where i at i don but i in a big room like as big as a gymnasium and i in there by myself which is kinda nice i can turn the radio on do whatever i want to some degree depends on who the manager is the time every manager got a different agenda on what they want you to do i thought it was stupid yeah well they needed to strike don get me wrong that not the stupid part but the part uh a majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and ain making that much money most people would move on the university never has money that like me when i first came here the university was not paying me nothing i worked two yiyr or two jobs for ten years when i was here the first ten years just to make a living yeah and uh i had the prerogative i coulda gone somewhere else and made more money yknow but well what the bad part was is university trying to do away with civil service civil service is a good thing and a bad thing yknow you do you had raises and everything so it least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have nothing it like where i work at the only way i can get raise is by being uh like the kids used to say a tattletale squealer whatever you wanna call only way i can get a raise over there where work at to be a rat yeah and it not and that not right so i ve always gotten two percent raises even though uh basically i been cross trained or however you wanna say it i can work in three or four areas where most people can but i ve seen people get ten percent raises and i ve seen me get two percent raise when i doing three jobs and they re doing one but it i using me as example because i ve seen a lot of other people do the same thing don get me wrong but it just depends upon it still come back to who you know because they done away with the uh civil service step raises which were wrong cause coulda done crummy job and got same raise as doing a good job don get me wrong but now it is that you got people you don even respect in management a lot of times giving the raises and they have no idea what you re even doing eyg example example that i asked my manager the other day she told me i was supposed to do this certain thing and i asked her i said well they told me i wasn supposed to and she said she get back to me on it well never heard nothing from her and she done that to me i don know how many times but yet that leaves the door open for who to get in trouble yeah makes her look good well it just like your piy people you see go to church that walk out of church see somebody sitting there that homeless they ll ignore them won they because they re in their good sunday clothes well basically the same thing here but some of your management is real good i ve seen people that that yknow are super but i ve seen people that are bad problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i don care who you are nice manager so yknow what i mean i can outlast them and i do my job that sometimes that basically hurts worse than if you do your job and people know you do your job you got more people that ll stick up for you without knowing it that fine well let me ask you this where the where the nearest teen club there is none where the nearest playground there is none where the nearest sports center there is none so there not a whole lot to do except for the hanging out so yeah i think society as a whole more violent the kids are more violent look at the news you see on tv every day you see people getting mad just cause they re sitting in traffic that adults see people now all sudden there a rash of fires you read that in news people keep doing it i think society as a whole has gotten lot more violent which made the kids more violent i don think it the cartoons cause come on if they re that stupid yknow what i mean they they shouldn even be out on the street i sorry cause that like me i watch the three stooges and you don see me put no crowbar up nobody nose yknow what it is is most people want don want kids to live in reality and uh these kids that are violent your whole society violent i got okay i just got done helping my sister in law that an example right there she got five kids she on welfare her husband is arab right he running an illegal business the united states knows about it they keh can sit there and they ll pay the welfare they won do nothing to him now what what kind of impression is her kids getting yknow well he uh exporting cars illegally yeah but he also like i said he got five kids they live in low income housing they re collecting welfare and she just came here and lived with me a year ago she could have her baby here so the state would pay for it so he wouldn have to pay for it and she went back to him well i think the people that made that law should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs for more than two years and see how they like it cause there some people that actually can work my sister in law is one of them she is just stupid she got like a third grade education she like a kid herself now people like that can work when i was a kid your family took care of you there wasn the welfare and stuff like this but you don have a family structure no more uh you re in a high tech society and most people you said you re from new york right your family where she couldn uners accept the fact that you could just disagree with her it had to be because she was black or she was an older woman or you couldn just disagree had to be a reason there but fortunately shuh she accused me of that in front of my boss who was black who didn believe it he knew better so yeah yeah it did and then she tuh but she was kind of a gossip she went around talking to everybody trying to get them all support her and nobody would support her they uh heard it all before and they some of them had known me for a few years but uh i was told lafter i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there than anyone else i don believe yeah um hum well i wasn i was in manager for about thirteen fourteen years and it wasn bad where i was before uh this management it was it was the whole department it was uh i don know what it was people they were always arguing and fighting it was just the whole atmosphere like of that place and it was just people that i known for years and gotten along well with were just they were different when they went in there they just changed it was just it was just not a good place to work yeah yeah i think there been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think even though i would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking him away from the otha the cousins i mean they ve the cousins have been stressing all along he needs family he needs family well there not much closer family than your father and that that that they love this country and this stuff well then accept the laws and follow them whether you agree with them or not um i th i i it was very unfortunate the way it happened uh but i think the government should not let it go on as long as it had right its the way i feel yeah wah we were talking about this at work one day and they said you know i su surprised you think that way because i tend to be a little left of center on most things sometimes far left but and i said now this isn i she said seems like that would be the conservative view my opinion the conservative view is they don want him to go back to cuba not to the communism or but people i ve talked to even extreme conservatives and liberals they all pretty much feel the same way that the ones i ve ta talked to i haven heard anybody that accepted the other the cousin side yet right yeah but it the conservatives and liberals are all agreeing on this that what i it not a presidential iss candidate issue as far as i concerned but uh i oh yeah even my mother who is a she said if nixon were running today she vote for him she that much of a conservative uh agrees with what happened but most people will say the same thing there should have been another way to get him out of there but at this point i don think there really was a a few months ago yeah but i think the news media have hyped it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that trying to escape from cuba to united states that found at sea is immediately returned to cuba whether you agree with it or not that the accord and that what kee that what castro that the premise he operating on uh you know and the news media they haven really been a ji they just they haven been real objective about it i mean uh you know like there two fisherman that found him at sea you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you don hear about him there three cousins two of them think he should stay miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you don hear about him i was reading about him news week or someplace uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this oh sure i sure uh right it it it more a it tends to be more of entertainment i don remember that being that way thirty years ago but it does now right well that something i ve noticed in the local news particularly latrih they say exclusively on our channel and stuff and it usually not that big of a deal what they re talking about uh but they re making a big point that you heard it here first and i mean if you hear it five minutes earlier on one station than another what difference does it make i just kind of appalled what they put on the news anyway it not usually what i consider news it lot a human interest stories and things like that which nationals getting that way too they re all heading that way anymore uh used to be an analysis with the news you don get that at all anymore right the kind of the a today syndrome light news uh that why i read tend to read the alternative newspapers and things because you do get a different perspective it it probably just as slanted but it is different you re right uh usually whatever ones i can find uh hey you got columbus alive and just not quite that yeah the local ones more than anything uh uh we would ride uh the bus downtown all the major sh uh stores were down there um uh there was a restaurant called mill restaurant uh yknow was all yknow glass you could see through there there were different uh levels uh it white table clothes yknow white napkins and yknow we go there for lunch yknow you dress nice and uh yknow i i like that and i would uh like yknow my grand kids to be able to go downtown with me like that yknow rather than have to drive off to a mall yeah i think they re trying to do more i hoping they will yknow crime is a lot worse now yknow on the streets than it used to be yeah yeah yeah yknow like when i worked in westerville i had bought my house because i used to live work um off of east north broadway and the freeway and uh i thought i was gonna be there forever so i bought my house yknow where i only had drive two blocks but then i had to move to westerville and uh one my jobs there was i was a hiring um supervisor for department and we had about a hundred and fifty people in the department and it was growing and uh i wanted to hire uh minorities and uh it was very for some of the younger people and students uh to get up there because of transportation issues so um yknow that one thing that that i hope that they they work on yeah yes i did not for the uh the train the rail service no i just didn see where it would be used utilized here right expanded bus service okay it very informal here so i don know what we re doing but like and the of is all those little words you re already supposed to know those you re supposed to be able to write a sentence even if it just a little short sentence like my name is joanne i live at blah blah blah street i mean it incredible it like the curriculum keeps moving down and down and down well they re supposed to do more too but by the time they get to fourth grade they re so busy trying to be the class clown they decide it a lot more important to impress your friends than it is to fill your mind with knowledge yknow they talk about drinking from the fountain now they re only gargling they re not drinking much by the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade they re pretty savvy these days they re not too scared to tell you where to go and what to do oh yeah oh yeah used to be when i first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful and they would ask yknow can i do this can i use this uh kids now if i take my phone off and lay it on my desk kids will walk right up and just take it they won ask me they ll just oh and then they start pushing but is this your phone i like uh if i were at your house and i went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking you wouldn like it much would you yknow just general manners i think it because parents are at work and they re busy making money and they re not teaching their kids any i mean they re not ta taking teaching them to say thank you and please and just the normal yknow um thanks for having me when you go to someone house just the normal i can tell you how many kids i ve picked up and driven home when i picked up my son because it was raining or something and they just jump out of the car and go bye slam the door and i turn to my son and i go don you ever do that to someone mother now how bad do you think i want to give him another ride home when he didn even say thank you yknow i didn have to bother to go out of my way and i always try to use that as a way to explain to my kids okay yknow this is how he handled it this is how i want you to handle it i don ever want you to go to someone house and not say thanks for inviting me thanks for having me i really had a good time yknow and i don ever want you to sit at somebody else table and go yuk i don like that yknow if they having something for supper you don like you pass it on and you go i don care for any thank you you don make a big scene like so and so did the other night at my house that yknow made me feel like this big when i the cook yknow so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do and you can say well that how that makes you feel when someone goes eew we re having ham i hate ham the other night i had ham and i threw up and blah blah and my mom made me eat it and i threw up all over the floor and i like don you ever do that when you re at someone else hou they know more knowledge i wouldn say they re more socially mature or uh more um um i mean there even sweet little preschool girls that don say please and thank you yknow you have to remind them well and i think it really sti it still goes back to the mom and the dad and and what the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy yknow would i act this way would that make my mom and because until you re about five or four your parents are pretty important to you and what they think so that when yknow you have to instill that stuff you have to yknow the oh and they learn by watching you do it too uh i mean my son now oh i saw him when let see he was fifteen maybe he run across the street when martha the eighty six year old lady across steereet the was trying to bring her garbage down he seen me do that go oh let me get that for you martha she got arthritis she looks like she gonna fall she takes steps about this big and i ve seen him do that he learned that from watching me do it he takes i it yknow we come home he ll take the bag the thing back up for her oh martha will fall if she does this i better run over there and take that up for her well he seen his mo his mom and his dad do stuff like that they really do learn best by example they really do yeah they do they re much more likely to do what you do than do what you say so you don have to say anything as long as you live a good clean honest life they re gonna emulate you oh i think i think that the society in uh general is declining in a lot ways our morals are degclining degrading declining and our uh intelligence level maybe not level i mean i are still high but people are settling for less i have a big sign in my room that says never settle for less than your very best because i really think people are getting lazy even adults we yknow we don even want to wait twenty five seconds for microwave popcorn we don yknow we re getting impatient yeah we re getting impatient and we re getting um it it sort of like yknow the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from now there ll be kids ll be yknow in this country will be learning more than they ever have but right now i think we re we re really not doing justice to the curriculum and i say to my friends i say teach these kids well because they re gonna be running the country in our old age we ll be sit in a rocking chair and they ll be running the country so you better teach them well when you look at it like that you it quite an investment when you think that our major resource is ch is our children and our offspring then we better not yknow well i think well i think in general like let say if you took a handful of executives from borden or a and or someplace like that you would probably find that in general they re very concerned if they re especially if they re over forty because their company giving money back to the community for this and that and yknow that how they re trying to show that they care about this they re trying to mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the downtrodden or yknow but you re right i think it terrible that every other country in the world has higher math skills than we do better science skills than we do better language shkills than we do why canadians even go to school for thirteen years not twelve yknow and i just think that this proficiency thing is finally going to make people accountable the proficiency tests that they re now requiring you can graduate from an ohio high school with a gra uh with a diploma unless you pass all the proficiency tests and that means you have to take one in citizenship which is like government and history one in math one in science one in writing and one in reading and you have you can try to pass the first time in the at the end of the eighth grade and you get two tries in the ninth grade two tries in the tenth two in the eleventh two in the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you don pass them all by the time you graduate you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate it not a real diploma it like okay i attended i didn learn anything but i was there how many people want that and the questions aren easy i mean i mean the i doubt if i could pass some of them i mean i probably could pass the citizenship and the and the english and maybe the science because i like science and i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass the math because i don teach math and i don use math that much other than just normal yknow add subtract multiply yeah and geometry and and trig and calculus and physics and a little smattering of everything and uh i bet i couldn pass the i bet i couldn pass the math without some instruction but my son didn pass the writing part he passed everything but the writing part and the writing part they ask you to write two five paragraph essays and they give you these topics and you can pick from them and you have to do it right there in like a three hour block of time no the prompts are only given out that day even the teachers don know what they re gonna be and it might be something as general as tell about your neighborhood or it might be something as specific as when you were little what toy was your most favorite and you have to write five paragraphs on it so no more than five because there a specific um it called the five paragraph essay the first paragraph is your introduction and the final one is your conclusion and the three in the middle is the body that develops your idea so i teaching all my kids right one of those on different topics oh it some committee i mean you have to send them in to some place at the state of ohio no we send them in and then the kids lets see the eighth graders take them in march and then we get the pa the scores back in may sometime and um some of my kids well i have a group of kids that i had them when they were sixth graders and they just now graduated the reds and indians um hum the reds uh more so than the indians back my younger days because they weren worth a damn but um hum um hum i not really a big fan uh i think one of the big problems is gonna be uh uh initially just the uh uh the monetary thing of it yknow the people that supported the uh basically supported the uh uh minor league teams that they had here yknow uh were like blue collar people and that you go for twenty thirty bucks and have a good time get drunk throw beer and and up there yknow you re not gonna be able to do that it gonna cost you uh a minimum of fifty to a hundred dollars probably take a family there couple of kids or something like that yknow well the minor league hockey team the columbus chill are never there um hum they don have it now but uh because the blue jackets came in but but i think it be good if it goes but i just not sure that columbus is gonna support something like that and it basically ohio state yknow and they don even support the uh hockey team we got fra ohio state yknow and yet they re good um hum um hum well the uh wolff family and uh the mcconnells have been around forever yknow uh worthington industries and and the wolff family columbus dispatch uh uh then you got uh i think it rozutti uh he like a was a construction guy so uh uh they ve been around forever and everything and uh they can get their ways through uh political arenas and everything but i think most the money was uh was private money but they were given like tax incentives and stuff things of that nature the old pen um hum yeah it an it was an old eyesore that they should have got rid of years ago but um hum well i think they tried to get some kind of a deal with uh when they were planning this thing and with uh with ohio state to uh yknow like have the schottenstein center down at uh down closer to downtown or or something like that and play half your ball games there or something like that but but ohio state don need that yknow they got their own stuff so um hum um hum yeah well that basically is ev yknow as your influx of people move outer city limits and everything yknow then uh yknow you got to have places for them to shop and everything and basically the northland mall been there forever jacob who owned indians owned it uh and he never did anything to it yknow so you got over at your lazarus or penney and uh mainstay places that generally move there because of the uh years ago because it was something well it was right there with wi with a lot of people population and everything and then li like i say if you yknow you got basically the people moving out to get away from the the traffic and all that stuff yknow not that they re moving away from it they re still getting into it but uh the district perspective on it uh then you hafta have if you build it they will come they say yknow so um hum um hum and i guess he still gonna build it so uh uh as it was jacob sold the northland mall anyway so it probably gonna be like a sh shopping a strip mall more or less um hum yeah which is good for me because i don ever go there anyway so and i one of those go in get what you want and get the heck out yknow and um hum i remember when i was married my my ex said do you want go uh shopping what just get me a couple shirts or something yknow she always bought my clothes anyway so so just get me a couple sh get me whatever you think i need yknow i ll be here drinking beer watching sports yknow it uh i live at um one sixty one and cleveland area in an apartment up there it ain that far it uh if you got a car it easy to get there yeah but if you if you re ride the bus it sometimes uh takes a couple hours so um hum um hum yeah i like to seen it pass just for the fact to see what the hell they would have done with the money but uh i don blame people for voting for the one and not vote for the other because you re talking about something twenty years i had a engineering a civil engineering friend years ago and uh i was a wo worked at ashland chemical which is over in dublin and i lived over where i living now and every year they were doing work on two seventy yknow so i get pissed off and uh bitch be bitching at him about it and everything yknow and he go you don realize yknow by time we get something approved through all the parameters you ve got to go through and everything and then they start working on it and then they get it done it already ten fifteen years old guess i never thought about it like that um hum um hum yeah um hum yeah goodale that i surprised they re not getting a lot of heat from that but because that park been there forever yknow um hum um hum yeah plus they have that uh which they ve had for like twenty some years a comfest or something uh which is big thing down there yknow uh local musicians and um hum um hum yeah but the ones that they really needed to do like two sev well like seventy one and seventy i mean that i don it a bottle neck area yknow and they really should have done something with that twenty years ago yknow um that probably when they started yeah um hum i used to when i was driving now uh plu especially when i was going through the uh going to two seventy things yknow i had people flip me off and stuff like that and i had a funny thing one time a guy flipped me off because he was going slow and uh i got all pissed off about him and went around him and everything yknow and i go to a work pull in at ashland chemical and who pulls in beside me but him i look over at him he looks at me like oh yknow i sorry i mean yknow i was um hum no we just both happen to work there um hum it over off of uh thirty three two seventy and thirty three ok huh wha where are ya uh where you from you say in where oh uh huh well uh i was born on a homestead out northern montana and then my parents moved back to iowa which was their home area southern iowa and i grew up there attended high school there and then i uh went to iowa state for five quarters and i just didn get it and uh i worked around home for a a year and then i we went into the army in nineteen forty spring of nineteen forty one before pearl harbor and i was in service for uh four and a half years in italy most of that time nor north africa and then italy and uh i had met a uh a uh girl before i went in the service and so when i got home why we were married and she had family out here in columbus she was originally from southern ohio but uh when i was gone she came to columbus and so i came here when i was discharged and i uh served an apprenticeship in a sheet metal worker shop or well it was more than just i mean there more than shop work we did erection work too and commercial work and uh i stayed with that until uh well for twenty five years however whenever that was then i got a chance to uh go to work for the city of columbus as a hea heating and ventilating inspector and i decided that it was that was more my speed when i was that age so i worked for them for the city as a inspector for twelve and a half years till i retired and uh my wife and i had four children four or three boys and a daughter my sons all live here in columbus and my daughter out in seattle in the redmond area i ve been active in church work sunday school all my life and uh tried to get my family in it with some success not com completely not as much as i like but uh i think they re all responsible well adjusted people and have families of their own i have nine grandchildren one great grandson and uh and the boys are all in the sheet metal trade also one of them working over here on the the uh stadium and uh i don know just exactly where the others are but they re wor he here in the columbus area my daughter a school teacher who been teaching for i don know ever since she got her degree and her husband works for a a uh testing company that does testing with uh i don know very much about it probably shouldn even say but ultravi ultraviolet uh with uh ultra or something or other ultrasound equipment and it really sort of interesting and let see my my youngest son wife is a teacher in the catholic schools elementary schools and my my second son wife works for the columbus school system as a secretary and uh actually transcribing notes for people who uh for men who ve are writing books or papers or whatever and then uh my oldest son wife is a secretary in the in the school in a she works i in a school building and she hears all the troubles and sad stories let see i don know that basically who i am hum yeah well i we were in north africa first for the north african campaign when rommel was still roaming and then when uh that ended up in the summer of fall of nineteen forty two i believe and uh then we we were sent to italy i was in the field artillery outfits uh six inch guns and uh well actually a neighbor boy whose draft number was smaller than mine uh i don know where he got the contact but anyway he went up to boone iowa and joined a national guard outfit uh which was field artillery and uh with the expectation of their being mobilized soon which they were and uh so he he was home one weekend and talked to me about it and i thought well field artillery i was exposed to that when i was uh in at ames so i thought that be better than carrying a rifle and so i went up with him and i joined up and uh so anyway we hand six inch howitzers which had a range of about sixteen miles and uh the shells were about ninety five pounds and they the high explosive shells had thirty seven pounds of in them so they make quite a bang when they went off and field artillery is really inter or i found it really interesting because those uh when you get into figuring firing data you get lost in mathematics almost back then you could of course now they probably have computers that figure it out and just zip zip and uh oh and then they uh we had to locate our positions on a map and i didn do that myself but we had a couple boys in the outfit who could uh find where we were on a map and where our our observation post was and where the enemy out here was and all that and uh it uh it re it is inter was interesting uh calculating trying to calculate where your shells were gonna land out there i was up i was only on the a few times but one time when we had a uh second lieutenant up there who was very well congenial i guess is as good a word as any and uh what we do is sometimes when we get into an area and we know that we had a field out here we be shooting to we would adjust on a target out there we pick a a building or some target there we could see and we ad adjust the guns call down shifts until they could come within reasonable close to that and then we we know where to shift from there to another target and uh he let me fire it one once range but i got about fifty or seventy five yards from the what we were shooting which would um see with those guns our of ours we figured within ten ten yards was a hit was a tar target and because if you had one of those things thirty seven pounds of go off within ten yards of it yeah i mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military and just as long as people don know that they don feel threatened see a and and i ha i uh i don i don understand that mindset i really don i don know why uh a man feels threatened by a having gay near them um i have a couple of gay friends and and one of my friends always says um yknow does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted to every woman and yknow want to go to bed with every woman yknow what makes a man think that just because i gay i might be interested in him yknow that the height of arrogance um yknow but but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i don know but it not a mindset i have so it hard for me to understand well it might right yeah i don understand it i really have a hard time understanding yknow they re not after you they just want to live a life um hum yeah um hum hm um hum i bet you have you just didn know i not sure where my father would have been and my father was very liberal uh more so even than my mother um because if it not something that part of your culture every day yknow and and you ve been told it wrong and the catholic church said it was wrong as mots most religions do i sure he would ve yknow had some concern but i think his his intellect would eventually have worked it out especially if you sat down and talked with him and he wouldn have done yknow there wouldn have been any gay bashing with him and um there wouldn have been yknow what happened yknow to the the black man in jasper texas and the yknow uh the the shepard boy in in what was that oklahoma uh yknow he wouldn of yeah hate crime is a is an is an interesting term um all crimes all murders are hate related i uh i not sure it that uh it it difficult i we had civil rights laws many people were opposed to those but it was uh in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism um a and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime and yknow are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and there already a a law on the books so i don think we need to have a hate crime over and above that yknow uh the th the the people who murdered matthew shepard should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and shouldn have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the uh affirmative action programs and the busing did to people it going to turn people against uh gays like it turned people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i ha i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and yknow going to yknow opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you disappointed that things aren better uh yknow that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that wasn my goal my goal wasn to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all white jury convict white men of com committing of killing a black man we re in hearts and minds now um hum an all white jury two white men and the third one on trial now be interesting to see what happens to him because he says he didn have that big a role in it right a um hum yeah but but but many people especially its a kid that young may not know what that really means and may it to be part of the group and part of the yknow be cool may go along with it when really they don like it i don i haven made up my mind about him whether he telling the truth or whether he hasn or whether he wasn well yeah me either yeah but i ve been in situations where people have told racist jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick the time to to challenge someone very carefully but in other situations i ve said i don find those types of jokes funny please don tell them anymore in my presence do what you want when you re with your other friends but don do it in front of me i don even like blonde jokes i find those sexist and um racist in a way and i don i when no one will tell them to me one day when i was still working in an office there were telling fifteen or twenty of them in a row and i just kept a stone face but at one or two i did kind of but they were trying to get me to laugh but i wouldn but um right you gotta pick your battles right yep um hum um hum right right or maybe it will yeah uh she might know her name she um on the school board well i don know if it monroe county or probably that is what a small world oh wow it is that weird um hum yeah need to pay the rent that um yeah um me or oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that where that family i told you about was the and when he was fourtee or sixteen and he really wants to go back so we ll probably end up there sometime but after i finish school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money i mean we don need to have a ton but we just should be least a little out of debt and yeah something i don know anything about it but he lived in lompoc which is um i think it near santa barbara but we ve talked about a i don know anything i heard terrible things about it but oh really san diego probably why yeah i ve heard that a nice place that nice yeah columbus um hum i went to end up in an alternative school system all along i i got into the lottery they i made it into every school i applied for so went to and high school well i didn necessarily want to but that my family started me out they um are alternative to the public schools um just i don know exactly how to explain it the only thing that i know is that i never learned to do anything i never learned math we had in our fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew times tables he had a big pizza party planned for so that if if whoever won yknow would get but we just went on field trips and had a great time it might be better was a guinea pig type situation it probably better in high school as more college prep okay no that fine and the battle at fallen timbers here my i rough draft would you fix it for me before i make my final copy so i ll get a good grade see i i tell them i said that what i here for yknow i here to help you use me to help you get better grades use me to run interference if you think you know the science but you re getting marked down because you can spell the words let me know i ll go talk to your science teacher tell her not to count your spelling or not yknow not to make you take the test without the little spell checker thing that in your book bag to let you use that i mean i do a lot of um what i call advocating for my kids with the regular ed teachers that don understand i go in and i say well yknow this is kind of a long test could he maybe take half today and half tomorrow or would you mind if he came out to my room ninth period during study hall because i have a free and i could like kind of monitor it and and read the words he doesn know so that he actually answering what the question really says instead of what he thinks it says so that you won be testing his reading ability but you ll really be testing whether he knows about magnetism oh oh yes they re getting better though they really are they re much better now than they were twenty years ago because trend is these students in the mainstream as much as possible so teachers are having to learn to for example yeah how to modify like i give in services all the time at my school for the regular ed teachers and i show them they go well that gonna make more work for me and i say how is telling the student to do every other problem instead of all forty of them gonna make i so or how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an eighty i for example and you know he not gonna get all the details and the battles and the years and the captain names but you just want him to get the overall gist of the french and american war was about this time uh period in history and this was the result and this is how long it lasted just the main concepts well there the kid that you say todd you study for the test and when you come in i ll let you answer anything on the test you know and anything you don know you leave blank and i ll just grade what you put down now that doesn make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concepts he ll usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a or a i mean there all kind of ways to modify uh reduced give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another students notes if his are crummy and he can can study from them we even have a thing at our school that it it looks just like notebook paper and it got the three holes and the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk but it yknow the two copies you write on the top paper so when you write on the white copy it comes through onto the yellow copy and at the end of the period the student just rips off the back copy and hands it to his friend so he didn have to write yknow if he wasn getting the notes and he didn spell them and he couldn read them later nobody has to know that so and so went down the hall and made a copy of so and so notes on the xerox machine for the dumb kid yknow you just yknow you just say to one student that sits in the front that usually a girl who usually yknow writes really neat and gets it all just go suzy would you use this paper today because we re gonna review for the test and then at the end of the period when the kids are leaving and give johnnie a copy of it the back copy would you do that for me well the girls usually write neater and they usually get a girl that doesn have a learning disability they usually get everything down off the board whereas the boys get a little distracted or they ll yknow maybe not si they don tend to sit up front they ll sit in the back so they can yknow jab their friend with a pencil and throw the paper wads and stuff so oh yeah almost always doesn matter what um the disability is don know why this is but they used to say eight to one now they re saying more like five to one doesn matter if it a speech impediment blindness retardation cerebral palsy deafness learning disa you name it there a always five to one more boys than there are girls and we don know why well deafness for example uh and blindness are not always genetic they don know why they just know that thit that shows up more in boys than girls this year i don have one i have sixteen students and i don have one girl fact i haven had any girls for a couple of years i usually have one or two girls and all the rest boys but oh they re not as many of them or you mean because well um in the lower grades i believe that they are because i think they should have some male role models the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than having to wait till they re in middle school to relate to a coach and up until then it always been a woman don go into elementary ed that much that often they do but there just not near as many of them i can count on one hand the number of um men teachers i ve known over the years in elementary ed practically yknow five maybe six that that probably why the boys don yknow really and it a fun job it really is i i ve only ever known one male that taught first grade and i knew one guy that taught third most the time if they go in to elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six but um i really think that if we let the boys be more exposed to men earlier then they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it not just a girly thing they would say oh well mister so and so thinks it important that i know this and he a real macho guy so i better learn it yknow i do i really do nowadays with the pay being better we are getting more men but in most ci in most area in most school districts it comparable to any other job now it used to always be low but like a beginning teacher in worthington starts at i think twenty six eight or something course worthington one of the three highest paid districts in ohio um but i it used to be that teachers just got paid lower than a starting fireman or starting policeman and yknow you in a sense you re out there risking your life everyday too now that kids are carrying knives and guns and things to school you never know if you re gonna walk into the building and and maybe not go home that day yeah yeah people say things like oh i wish i had a job where i got three months off every summer and i just i hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store and i just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game i was grading papers at the kitchen table yknow and if i go out of town on the weekend i have to take my school bag and all my work with me it never ends yknow i put in about seventy hours a week during the time of the year when i do teach and by the way it not three months anymore you work for a week after the kids get out of school in june which usually puts you at about the twelfth to the fifteenth of june school starts back the twenty third of august at least in worthington it did and you have to be back a week before that so they ve shaved both ends of that off till it it like days in june and maybe fifteen days in august and all of july so and then you spend some of that time going to seminars and upgrading your certificate taking classes hopefully that when you go to the dentist yknow you catch up on all that stuff too right if you re lucky but i mean there the person that says that and then there the other person that says oh i sure admire what you do and i wouldn be a teacher for anything in this world yknow and the the one that just in awe of you and then there the one that like i wish i had two weeks off at christmas well i used to work at harding hospital as a teacher when um i first went to worthington when i said i got another job i got a job working at harding hospital as the i was the principal but i was also a teacher so i taught part of the day and i was also the administrator because they had a small school there for the kids that were in the adolescent unit and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credit somewhere so the doctors always used to we were on the like each person would be on a team of these kids that would be assigned to these kids and you go to your team meetings and the doctors the shrinks would go i wish i got two weeks off at christmas yknow they be bitching and moaning about the fact that that we got time off and they didn finally come up with the perfect thing one time i said well doctor simpson or whatever his name was doctor brown you know how it is some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off he never said a thing again like oh okay we went for the big bucks we went for the time off everybody makes their choices now you got to live with them these kids don get well just because it the holidays you guys should stay here and work along with us yeah right we should also get a hundred and twenty five bucks an hour like you guys do to oh i ll come back i mean if you need me to um hum well the furniture the dining room sets the the uh chairs the couches because they re they have enough money to buy new things and they don want to necessarily send it down i don think to the salvation army or the i i don know but i think that they think that there a better way of giving away and like good will they resell and salvation army they resell well we we we just started reselling yeah um hum no no doesn happen overnight child care i know it i know it and theresa the founder also realizes that if you can break that cycle through the children so the focus and the emphasis was really on the children yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah really ah yeah um hum um hum yes yes no kidding yeah where they need it right yeah right um hum hum um hum um hum um hum oh yeah yeah oh sure yes franklin park south is wonderful too or franklin park out east is beautiful too off of east broad street now that volunteer also their guards are volunteer and they re on a grand scale that where the uh conservatory is uh right um hum hum just getting over there it pretty far i help janet somewhat but not a whole lot i i have a project i work on not as much as i probably should but it the swan cleaners project and what we do we have little houses donation boxes in all the swan cleaners and there probably about hum probably a good forty forty five of those throughout the city so i in charge of that and i do some volunteer there that for the benefit of the homeless families foundation and um other than that i just do housewifey things and yknow after being it the first i ve been retired since last march so i adjusting to being home and not being so yeah really and and i mean i have to work at because i ve been so busy for the last twenty five years yes makes it hard makes it difficult it an adjustment i did have a sh a part time job i loved it it was just four hours a day but they wanted me to go full time and i just didn feel like i wanted to go full time so i was working as a receptionist and uh answering the phone doing some light filing just a variety of tasks office type tasks and i really liked it i liked the hours but i didn want to go eight hours compared to four so i left but our belief is that it didn it it needed to be restored an and we believe i don know if you ve heard about joseph smith or well we believe that um that revelation that was there on earth was actually restored again and through joseph smith because he had a desire in his heart to know what was true and he prayed and he actually had a vision where he saw god and jesus christ and i know this is all really i mean this is like deep doctrine stuff but and um and he was told that there were nah none of the churches on the earth were true that some of them had good things but they their um they weren exactly hitting the mark and that i it was gonna about to be restored again and so we believe that the true church is actually restored again to the earth and it was through joseph smith and he translated the book of mormon with help from god and so that basically it i mean the book of mormon is a counterpart to the bible it a it from prophets that lived in america so you knew you ve heard about that probably oh okay it easy to for um hum it i it it american in the from the fact that it um it was written by native americans and and um and joseph smith was an american and he was used to to translate it so it is and it it actually funny though but there st there more members of the church that live outside of america it gotten to the point where there there more than five million outside less in america then the that exactly what it i yeah oh there was a lot of discouraging things just i mean i learned so much it wasn and it wasn always just people rejecting you that was discouraging because that was kind of funny at times people would you you dock on the door and they would yeyal yell that they weren home or something and and so it was kind of funny but but the discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that don have any hope and they get so they re just so poor and they and and you i we we felt sometimes like we could help them but they didn want any help and it was kind of hard to just say okay well i did what i could and i mean not saying that they had to believe what we believe but just even just the their attitude about life was so down and yeah they were just so there was other things right yeah like we had our service we clean up neighborhoods or yeah there was a lot of different things um hum no i think they liked that it wa it was really funny because here if you went into a a school or something and said we wanna help we wanna teach a class or we wanna clean or anything they would probably say yknow they might think it was kind of weird but they would let you yknow but they would be like you wanna do this and we don have any money to pay you oh but we don yknow we don want money that the whole point we re we wanted to serve you mm they they didn get that at all they were like some people would just be like no no way it doesn make sense probably a little bit um hum there is yeah it be a lot more accepted i think here even though it might be kind of i wouldn do that um on my own but if i i felt like that was what i was doing all the time so full time oh i think the one of the things that we when when you re baptized is that you re really supposed to help other people to na like if if yi somebody gives you a gift you wanna give it to someone else but it easy a lot of times just to fall into the yknow like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weirdos yknow they don wear makeup or whatever but we we we can wear makeup if we want but so i think a lot of times people do fall in to sort of but i i was not raised mormon so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it so new to me that i am just yknow i will talk about it with anybody and and and so and i also not afraid of people who aren mormons because i think if you grow up like a member of the church and you might be af more afraid of people that don believe like you ve been taught i think a lot of the yknow we don drink alcohol we don there a lot of restrictions i guess you call them restrictions but they re el i feel like they re more just health codes just keep you healthy and so um it might be it like if we wu america yknow we re we re used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might wanna get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about yknow stame kind of thing but i i not i don have any of those barriers since i ve been on both worlds well and and it really isn though because once because i think it actually it really freeing not to have to drink and all these things so you just kinda i feel like i can get along with any people and so it doesn really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and nobody perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that is a is part of life for um hum no they were from all over the world i had um one companion who was from russia but she was on a temporary mission i uh mostly all over america but there was a girl from mongolia um there was girls there who i never was companions with them but they were from russia different mm there was a girl from moscow um my mission president was actually from saint petersburg and his wife they they didn speak english you just get sent wherever um hum it it funny because i had studied russian but a lot of the people i served with were fluent in spanish or something else so it like i don know why they got sent there but it i i mean we really believe that there that it inspired they send our your name and a picture and your application to the prophet who is the head of the church and um they pray over it and they decide where you go so it and sometimes it ll take a while to get your call what they we call your calling or your call but then you just it exciting to find out where you re gonna oh my right right that is surprising oh yeah oh yeah yeah i mean it just sort of like the whole reputation of yeah america just being like the country of excess like excess possessions excess food excess weight excess money yknow everything yknow and it it yknow i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for about a year and a half and i back and yknow this i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of mainland europe and everything and i come back and yknow where my parents live there were all these yknow new strip malls built and stuff and i just felt like i was in yknow this like giant land you know i it just was so overwhelming even though obviously i grown up with in america my whole life and yknow not that i sort of completely but you do when you ve been away from it and to come back and yknow to go into these like places and like just the other day my friend took me to easton and i mean you walk in there and i don feel like i in columbus yknow i feel like it got to be california or something just because it just definitely wow right was she where she from latin america oh okay um hum um hum right oh right um hum oh i bet right and just totally bombarded and i mean here it so force fed as well i mean i i home just before halloween and yknow i i walked into the grocery store and i mean just like right there were just like cookies like everything just right in front of you with like all this halloween stuff on and i mean all the holidays in here are pushed at you and it such a money making yknow and it so over the top where there it sort of like there a little bit of that and there are decorations and stuff at christmas but it isn so much yknow and and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around i mean there there isn that at all i mean at least yknow my there and i mean i can imagine because yknow western europe i think sort of as much like america as you can get probably yknow most places elsewhere in in the world and i mean that would have been a fantastic experience right right right wow um hum absolutely um hum um hum well there the whole theory that yknow it has to drop back at some point but i don see it happening any time in the near future and ydow uh as with a lot of the resentment that felt that i experienced toward americans rather saddeningly i think our culture is starting to really infuse itself into europe at least i mean i see instead of us becoming more like them yknow becoming more like us walmart has bought yknow a uh retailer there so yeah and and it just it moving there the whole yknow strip malls and i was in i spent my first there in belgium with a friend and i mean we would drive by and she be like oh this is because of yknow your country these people are moving in and buying and so i see it moving in the other direction unfortunately rather than really wow oh yeah is there the resentment to things like mcdonalds there is it right oh right right right right right because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there were a lot of jibes about that i remember um driving to germany with a couple a english friends and to visit some german friends of theirs and we got there and it we we got lost and all these things that took us way longer than it should ve and a friend of the person we were visiting said like oh what did you have to stop at every mcdonalds along the way and i was like a i i a i don even eat at mcdonalds yknow and i was yknow and it was really mean it like isn really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but yknow i always said mcdonalds wouldn survive here if no one ate there and you can tell me that everyone in there is american and they never were i mean the same with like in france especially oh mcdonalds well mcdonalds was full of all the french people yknow i mean right highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad uh and again as i mentioned previously i think it more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of yknow the different students with each other and i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and i mean you re you re never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and different cliques but i can help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that yknow had to have been more than just yknow sort of normal jocks versus whatever so i think it should be more i don know i mean even yknow i went to a private catholic highschools but even there yknow there was yknow uh a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should definitely not have been going on and that was only on a very small level there were eighty six people in my graduating class yknow and i mean this is a highschool with like several hundred students that this happened at so um hum um hum i think in fifth grade was the first um i mean at that point i uh i certainly didn have any uh real knowledge about of that sort of thing um yknow they covered the basics they did talk about condoms and um contraception i remember we watched a film which everyone was very embarrassed by um i mean i don really uh they uh they did send home a packet to the parents because i remember being really upset and not wanting my mom to talk with me about um but yknow i think what they did was fairly good they didn really as far as i remember at that point at least they didn well they must have done gone into the sort of moral issue um but it i what i remember was more of a scientific approach um hum right all i remember is them talking about condoms i don think they talked about anything besides that but um then again i could be remembering um but yes that mean it is the stance but i think in the schools i mean that sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they re a little bit more realistic i mean this wasn i mean it was a catholic school but we didn have nuns or anything there i mean um yknow i think they were sort of more concerned with yknow it it actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a coup ah like eight grade that they talked about condoms i doubt that they would ve done that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point yknow some sort of um hum um not really because i think yknow if they re going to they re going to and i don think a lot of them at that stage are gonna go out of their way to go and buy them so i don think it like oh i have a condom i going to have sex i mean actually it this is is very hot topic in england right now because they they ve got the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world and i mean there are stories everywhere about yknow twelve year olds having babies and i mean there they ve gone to distributing condoms on playgrounds which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurses office is one thing they re there yknow they can go and and get some or something but i think actually like physically yknow passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just yknow uh because of the simple fact of the statistics that they re they are doing it so at least at the very least they might as well be yknow safe about it um well actually it sort of all happening in a certain area yknow with yknow very high unemployment like council council states um yknow the sort of stereotype yknow kind of bad family environment yknow parents have lots of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and yknow a lot of these girls that have been interviewed yknow say oh yknow i wanted something to love or yknow we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling and yknow a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed was saying oh yknow he had yknow slept with like ten girls or something and i thinking oh my gosh yknow and he thirteen and yknow had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have they yknow they get unemployment because once they ve had a kid even if they re not of working age they get like a an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think um fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby they re provided they re li like the top of the list for a council house so they get their own there was actually a long documentary on before i left um yknow of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents and yknow her parents were at the end of their rope she got pregnant and she was like well yknow hey this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets money for herself money for the baby she doesn have to pay any utilities or anything and yknow what more could she want yknow was basically what she was saying i ve got my own place i can do whatever i want i getting money and i don have to work and and so that i think is a very bad situation because they re almost rewarded for yknow um hum um hum um hum um you ll i i just got back from a year in england so i not sure about the new right stay on it right um hum um hum i don know i don know if i could trust him yknow because that that happened where he like i won do it again and and he did it again i feel once a cheater always cheater to me yknow maybe maybe to the next woman he won do that to but he gotten away with it so many times with me i feel like he wouldn really do it yknow if he wants to yeah anybody capable of changing if they want to um hum he would a absolutely have to build my trust for a long time um hum um hum um i first of all couldn be her friend because i mean i ve got a lot of i this man to death it like and that might be something that was is holding me back from dating but yknow it will eventually go away but um yeah i would warn her i don care if i if he he looks like the perfect guy because yeah i think he looks like the he a very nice guy yknow he just doesn know how to stick with one woman i don think yeah um hm they like me but then they don like me yknow th they i uh i think they re two faced very much two faced the mother especially because i ve i know she talked about me and stuff which hurts my feelings because i i i mean i might cause um him to yknow i don cause him if he yknow and when he at their house we ll get in an argument and that what does it makes them not like me because the the yelling and stuff but i don i feel i feel like i not the one that makes him yell he the one that yelling in their house and yknow he the one cursing and causing all the rackets but yeah he yeah he twenty six yep nope i met him through a friend i met him through his brother was dating my best friend yeah but he always um he had like girlfriends where he lived with them and he had a child and they live together but he cheated on her so that broke that up and he still messed around on her and then he was dating another girl and i like told on him and that made him not like me for a while but now he with that girl he was cheating on with he with her now they live together so he like going through a pattern too and i he a ver they re like they re real nice people it just they i yknow feel like they don and i try to tell him yknow don mess up again i just like grow up yeah but i ve got more influence i think maybe i not sure i hoping i ve got more influence over him than his father does um hum no yeah they yeah she moved in with him um which i so happy for because she didn she dated a little bit when we were kids but she did again like yeah she wa she was just by herself for like years and years she fifty now and she got a divorce when i was three so she and hopefully they will get married soon they ve been together for over a year and a half yeah he a real nice guy yeah um hum yeah me and my mom are real close i talk to her every day i talk to all my family my brothers and sisters every day um hum yep yep uh my oldest she the oldest um she got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because they she never sees him um and then they got two other girls and they live together got a house yknow they re on they re going through marriage they ve been together for like five years and they re not going they re not doing very right now but hopefully yknow they ll get over that and then i got an older brother who um him and his girlfriend moved in together and they just had a baby they just had a baby couple days ago yeah they had a little boy and i got a little sister she is twenty two and she lives with her boyfriend she doesn have any kids and she works and he works so everybody does pretty good now yeah my aunts do i think my grandpa goes to church yeah i i want to i just don do it oh you to learn about god yknow he doesn know anything about god right now i don think at all um no i pray at night yknow i don think he knows what i who i praying to or anything like yeah i will yeah i will explain that to him sunday school yeah oh it was on saturday oh okay yeah that why i i would like him to get the sunday school i would like him to go to them classes before sunday yknow prayer and all that nope i i don i wouldn i will i not sending him to a columbus public school but an alternative one school i will send him to um private school i don i would if i had the money to tell you the truth i would most definitely but i know i couldn afford it that why i ve never thought about it really no they ve just gotten a lot worse like um my niece they my sister had moved in with me for a little bit when her and husband was having problems and my niece is uh eight well she was in fifth grade in there a elementary school that we went to when we were kids and she just said they were cursing smoking cigarettes and everything and i just am like oh my gosh yes i mean it really bad these days my mom works for the columbus public schools the food service and she knows that they re really bad and that really sad but they re not doing anything about it um hum um hum well i think they got that all off of um the tv i mean that influenced um you just i think if you re open enough with your children these parents and say you know we we want to give you this option we really prefer you don do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected i mean i think that the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i gay i don know if i gay or what well hopefully they ll know their true identity eventually i mean yes some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were gay okay were they gay before but they did like women yknow and they did want the children and now they live in gay relationships but they said all along they were gay they just fought it and they they didn want the pressure from their families so ah you know i i just think the more you re open about things i just think that the best why it yknow when you put things and don talk about it that when the problems start but i think kids in high school and stuff some of them like my brother in law is gay and when i met him i knew he was i yknow he was the type some of them you can tell well it doesn matter what they look like um but my husband said all through growing up he liked men he didn like girls he looked at magazines you know all this stuff and i thought that so funny because growing up i just didn know know anybody that was um but you know he was openly gay to his mother right from the beginning and she was from germany which made it a little tough because yknow they didn talk about those things over there at all for a long time but um then she became very open with him and every but everybody knew and that was in the eighties and yknow if some kids know it when they re young and growing up yknow i don know if it best to not say it or to yknow be open but if they re open to their parents about it then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better then than if they wait later on in their life yknow but some of sometimes i guess they change yknow most the men i knew right off the bat know i mean i mean it was it and it was all through their life it wasn as though they just said oh i go i going be gay so i just with that terrible thing that happened montana with that boy and just just shows the ignorance in so many people it at that really still bothers me that there there is still so much of that going on you know it was it is um hum um hum it does yeah they have the gay pride parade and everything which is good they should be able to yes well yes but you know what his parents are gonna yknow really going to let people know that this just can go on not that they re going to stop it totally but it made a lot of people more aware that it still really going on yknow and his parents accepted him which they have to you can you can be mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle you just can life too short you know i mean you can love them either way it doesn make any difference they did i think so um hum right right that is no i don either because i believe in the death penalty and i feel taking a life like that leaving someone there just to die tied up to a fence you know i think they deserve to die because with the prisons and the overcrowding that a whole another subject you know that it just amazing to me so many people are in there that should be dead i feel because we re just paying for them to live in there but um yeah i would say for the most part that that not is not really true um i would tend to say most people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean there no sinister group than the other that i know i mean obviously everyone has their dark side but i say nm in general people are pretty good people i mean there nothing bad about them or anything that they oh yeah all the time yeah that part was no different i mean no um there were one or two um i guess that would be a slightly different part i non not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools but mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year um so i sure that increases the rate in public schools from the catholic schools expelling um what they do uh they have like up to four or five months the first four or five months pregnancy they re aloud to maintain once they start to show they don let them go to the school anymore just for their uh health of the baby um so they sort of send them on their way or whatever and she did have the opportunity to come back uh onshe th she was through with her pregnancy but she did end up just going to a public school kind of yeah um actually this case i do know what happened to the father i think he ended up moving to colorado um no nothing at all it it was known that he was the father like i said i mean he he was kind of uh just one of kids and i mean he didn listen to anyone or anything and he ended up like running away from home basically and like i said going out to colorado and like on his drive down there his car broke down and his parents like wired him money for him to get a plane ticket to come back and he ended up just taking the money fixing his car with it and kep kept on going so i mean he was just one of those people i guess i mean there was really no hope for um i probably would like i said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it um not necessarily the catholic beliefs or anything like that i mean that something that i don know i sorta make known to them but not something that i really push on them um sort of let them make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do where they wanted to go with it um well as far as my mom goes she real into the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that and i think that probably why i feel the way i do now why i wouldn push it on them cause that almost made me be resentful towards being catholic just the fact that i had it forced on me for about seventeen or eighteen years and just reached the point where i had enough of it and i mean i didn want anything about it and i mean that not to say that i don like being catholic or whatever it doesn so much bother me it just having it forced on me like i said just sort of gives me a different opinion of it and the real meaning behind it so nope she does know that i don go to church um she doesn so much mind anymore i mean since i ve turned eighteen i mean ever since then it been no problem or anything i mean she sort of let me have my own opinion but i mean i honestly do think i at least go to church on occasion if it wasn forced on me i mean it just got sort of ri just to the point of being seventeen eighteen years every single week of the year i mean it just got to the point where i had enough and i didn wanna go um both of them are older my sister like twenty seven twenty eight and my brother twenty four um they have started again recently uh they sort of hit the same point where they just had enough of it too and stopped um but recently they are getting into going to church um um neither one of them married or has kids uh my does hasv have boyfriend for um probably like three years or so and there is talk about them like marriage and kids and stuff like that with them um like they re living together things like that um as far as my brother goes i can say i see my brother too often um he does live in town um but usually he either at work because he works fulltime then he has he a part time student columbus state um so i don really see him during the day and then at night he usually goes out does his thing i go out and do my thing so i mean as far as what going on with him i really don know but i i know i mean there nothing real serious going with him or anything like that um not really he i mean he obviously to church too for at least a few years um while they were my parents were still together but i mean since then i mean there really nothing about him not really i mean she i don my mom kind of weird like that she she more believes in the religion aspects of it not so much as what the catholics believe about it um like their views on outside of religious matters um she just more agreeds towar with their views of god or what not as opposed to what the catholic church actually thinks is correct and what should be done yeah yeah um probably would ve been about six years ago i been in sixth or seventh grade yeah i lived with my mom since then uh my dad is remarried um he probably been married for four or five years she pretty nice i mean she definitely at least standable and acceptable so um hum yeah um yes and no like i said i think the average person is pretty decent person i mean i don think that there anything violent or that there anything wrong with them but at the same time it just the media focuses on the one that are out of control and makes a big deals of the ones that are out of control and i think that sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they don they don show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high school like volunteering at like the local senior citizens home or something like that instead they pick up on oh so and so was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give background on him and that what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what going on when the media only showing one side of the story i mean there definitely much more out there that going on than they re telling you um so i really don see a big problem with the way the america going or whatever the youth um and like say i wouldn say it any than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they weren around for it um i mean gave me these leading questions and i said uh huh i know where you re coming from i been confronted with that when i was at ohio state and so forth and um so i just layed it on the line to her in my own civilian terms i said why would you wanna give up on the original yknow why would you wanna give up on the original have a copy because all these others wannabes well in other words you follow christianity the catholic church is the first christian church and all the others are fragments they wannabe they still tie back to it but uh don want it like the commitment i was telling you well i like to but could you make a little extra give me two more minutes to make that field goal oh yeah we ll give you those but okay then we ll start we ll start only up here and we and we ll organize all this stuff but then we re gonna give two extra minutes in our rules okay we gonna live this way and uh so forth so we we we develop things as they accommodate to our own selfish not to the sacrifice of what we should be doing and we re all mortal and we re all gonna be in that and we re i not saying no one makes those errors makes errors it always there the problem is to try to stay focused on that not to jump ship yknow they say in this country oh you don like leave it why would you wanna leave you said you re a third world country why would you wanna be to table to i been i wouldn this this country has a lot of problems it just like my family has a lot of problems why would i aa iy aa leave the family why would i leave the country why not work with it and correct it cause when i run away from it yknow what i doing i running into another chaos at the other end someone else coming the other direction and they haven resolved things and that been happening our society we haven sit down to learn and understand one another um hum well as i told my daughter when she came i said yknow religion is is is a business she says oh no dad it not religion i said it sure is a business i said it just the superficial things the packages are attractive to you and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite article every now and then um hum i said but when you get down to the meat of it it the same thing and i said and that where it comes down to the catholic church for example they can put all you can have folk masses you can do all this superficial stuff on the thing to make it more attractive and they do every every religion makes it more attractive for her oh as used to come from oh yeah but the bottom line is you re trying to still if you re a christian focus back to the bible okay how do you do how do you get back to the original without being part of the original well my question is who more important in our basketball team the five starters or the sixth man coming off the bench i ask you now who ask george reese is he more is he less important this year than he was last year well that i making an analogy with you women who more important who saying that not being not being a priest is not important being your individual we re all called to be important a priest is just as a occupation a part of that society out there he do president of the united states isn any better off than you are he shouldn be what we re animals we re animals everyone looking for leaders it the rules of church simplest rule so if you want get to me two more minutes a play okay now you got another leg but the thing is let me ask you question how does that impact you if you can be a priest aren there other important quote unquote roles for women in the church aren there other important roles aren there other important roles what would those nuns be where would your mother possibly been if she went to catholic school i take it where would she have been if it weren for the nuns why we put nuns down hey they worked lot less than your mother is even getting compensated for and they had a very important role for your development even though you re generation is removed well that gets back to what you re saying almost th the family life hey what ahead what you don need a husband all you need is a sperm bank that what you re saying aren you aren you yes you are you re saying you don need to have a leader in the family you and if i gonna be a leader i gonna be the one i gonna be the one not the sperm bank oh you came from this little tube here oh okay that the principle family no i hafta be because there no father here well again they set different roles the they set different roles up fine give me two more minutes to play the problem is lack of commitment the lack of commitment and not saying hey there a niche for you you can be a male oh yeah you wanna do the operation i can be feeling yeah you wanna do well why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you can be that the thing but the thing is some people some people say some people say well watch this the thing is why don you talk to those people and say hey why not do what i doing best in other words compliment the team yes um hum right so we lower the standards to meet that product certain things but they they want everything to be the same they can be they can be the same it just a natural thing but the thing is let them do what they can that a god given talent what you have there okay nurse and how many refuse the nurse voluntarily when they have children why talking among you women folk why do you have well i don want to you have the natural ability to give all the all the natural protein the immunization things all that maternal milk why can you instead of getting off the shelf it just a rule it a rule coming down hand down tradition there a tradition you see now you re looking you re looking for reasons that looking for science and go back and ask them as as as i would ask uh uh my uh english teacher in school uh anybody that said well what this poet uh what was his now he wrote this um ah i gave my interpretation no no now they say no no that wasn it they share their thought how do you know that was it he been dead so how do you know how do you know as a teacher how would you how could you cut down a student and say no that not the way it was and it nothing you re learning from a teacher guide no but how do you know if i ask in the first but it a matter of tradition of handing it down to the tradition itself it a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way and that way and it it not necessarily written down but it passed on those days probably written down or not written down but verbal and extended and so it that hand down from generation tutter maw tuttle tuttle mall around tuttle mall thirteen years uh huh uh huh uh huh uh i was going through a divorce parents both parents passed away uh my ex moved to saint louis didn tell me anything about it or foreclosing on the house and that how i found out she moved and just a bunch of shit and i just started uh screwing up so they wanted to put me on probation and my uh rebellious attitude or whatever said i quit was pretty stupid really but um hum yknow what happened like in the same year eighty eight yknow so but it was it was pretty tough but i just didn deal with it properly yknow i should ve went and got counseling and by the way i probably should ve got marriage counseling but i refused to do that too so but i didn think i had a problem i thought she was the one with one um hum um hum um hum but she doing fine um she was dating somebody i don know whether they really got married or not yknow because i don really have that much communication with her but some guy younger than her and i talked to him he seemed like pretty decent guy yeah well it was rough not the actually going through it yknow to me it was to her but the aftermath basically yknow you gis at each other throat for this that and the other and and yknow devon is uh my daughter the one that really got put in the middle of it yknow and probably it was a blessing that they moved to saint louis because there probably could ve been more uh problems legal problems yknow as far as uh going back and forth to court and putting her on the witness stand for stupid stuff yknow and so uh in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there no i ve never i ve i used to uh have an office out there that i visited all the time but uh i ve never been out there to she actually lives in kirkwood which is a suburb um hum so uh that where she went to high school and everything uh but i had no i ve never went out there uh my my ex still has family here so she comes back a couple three times a year and i generally try to hook up with her and it been a while but as she got older yknow she wants to be with with her uh playmates and everything as they get older yknow so and having went through that myself i understand that so no it got kind of rough to have her here for a couple three weeks out of a or a month or something like that yknow during the summer um hum or they don really give a damn that the thing that uh i ve got i ve got some friends that with kids and i see it like on the bus or with uh yknow when you re working somewhere and uh where you people treat there kids yknow as a i mean i didn have the greatest childhood i don think any of us ever really had the best yknow but but i don like i wouldn talk to my kid the way some of these people talk to them but um one today yknow and she got on the bus and the little girl went and set over here she probably about eight maybe six or something like that and she wanted to set here her mommy so she made her set with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kid trying to study her homework yknow for not that well i don know was she up all night partying or was she up all night working yknow or what the hell is your problem um hum but the little girl setting there going mommy you need to go help with seven like seven nine times nine sixty three yknow and her time tables and stuff yknow and so uh yeah i see like younger kids to with kids yknow and and think yknow man your just not only have you wasted you you screwed up your life you re gonna you also screwed up your kids yknow i was twenty well i was thirty one when devon was born so my ex was twenty eight so we were both older not that that really helped as far as but i think it gave her so some and i wouldn say i never got mad uh but i ve gotten mad at devon quite a few times yknow because i didn like to some of the things that uh she would either say or or that she would do or uh but yknow i try to let her live her life yknow i think there love nobody can teach anything unless you learn it um hum um hum yeah she went to school here till uh ninety one actually uh so she was let see about the fourth grade fifth grade something like that um hum yeah mm i think it could ve i thought she get a better education out there uh now at saint louis school public school district she probably district she probably would ve had the same as here but by being kirkwood yknow and relatively small and everything um i think we maybe had uh a hundred and some kids in our graduating class yknow so uh i felt i got better attention when i wanted it yknow uh then i would ve at a at a bigger school um hum um hum um hum yeah much too fast for me yknow my i know the way we yknow the way we dressed and everything yknow it was kind of appalling to to the parents and everything i guess maybe that where i coming from i mean uh the way some of the uh kids dress yknow retro back to when with the bell bottoms and everything to us and the uh the piercings i just can get into that yknow and then some of the girls i mean they yknow i mean my god they at fourteen six fifteen years old they look like they re twenty some years old yknow and that what they want to look like plus you watch some of these stupid shows on tv yknow you sit there and go man i couldn believe ma my daughter don do that yknow it when she around me never when she away from me i don know what the hell she does well i think uh in my opinion i think main mainly the uh i it its the absence of uh basically parenting yknow uh my mom was there um she was a housewife yknow and uh so she was she went to work after i think when i was a junior in high school yknow and my brother they all my brothers and sisters are graduated yknow so um hum and that hurt her to go she dx ih didn thought she was letting yknow neglecting me i was in um hum thought about it i ve come home get in the car and go out go somewhere yknow or come home get something to eat and yeah that was about it i ah but i think that has a lot to do with it um i don really know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid and watching howdy doody and all that stuff and course it wasn the uh violent stuff maybe that you can see on tv now or uh but i don really think the media just hasn had that much to do with it it just a different time now uh i mean i remember uh one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast yknow with uh uh the vietnamese guy uh vietcong guy getting his brains blowed out on national tv yknow and uh uh that didn make me go out and um want to do that yknow so if anything it made me want not want to do it yknow because my brother was in was in vietnam he was in the army and uh when i got my notice he like three years older than me yknow and he so i mean it don they ll draft you they ll put you on the front line i said well i going to enlist in the airforce anyway so of the medical school class which is two hundred twenty yeah yeah i ll be starting in two thousand three um the first year they made it in state only um second and the second class that they re gonna be starting they have some people from michigan i think yknow they re just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it ll be something a little more nationwide but they really just wanted to start off with something easy and um they only take national merit scholars in there so um national merit scholars also get full in state tuition the that why it mainly appealing to in state people you they pay you to go to school yeah that is one of the uh one of the whether if it it a written goal or not that what they re doing yeah it is and it seems to me that they don keep the very very best of the kids in state but it gets a lot of the like just below the absolute best in it keeps a lot of them here where they could go somewhere else um i think ju just having like such a low cost i really helps and um i don know i think having just tha having the word honors gives it some kids enough prestige that they don totally freak out about not going ivy league yeah parents are very into this um my sister has no idea where she wants to go but uh they took me around to all the different colleges to be sure what i wanted they re just like go to yeah well she went with us last time and she liked some stuff but i think she ll end up coming here anyway um i went to me see i applied to emory harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those and they they were neat places but i know oh definitely definitely i such a slacker here it yeah from what i hear actually the like the emory and the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have got into harvard and then start yknow try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works because they re like we already made it yknow yeah i mean like it just it provides an a a window of opportunity for those who really do work like i know the valedictorian of harvard like in the junior class i she went to my school she just barely works at all apparently yeah like nobody oh she is really plain smart i but you don really have to work as hard there apparently yeah i yeah that another thing i hear about i don yeah yeah i hear about suicide rates when you don get in i uh i think yeah i think i got really good uh um i ve actually been sitting thinking about it like what departments in school were good and which ones weren um the foreign language is really good they have immersion classes from like at second level so i got into an immersion class here everybody else was freaking out and i was just used to it yknow um no english totally like the directions and the homework and everything is all one hundred percent in german so it and we had like tapes we listened to of native speakers so you got really good really quick my yeah it was like freshman or sophomore year yeah um i took one oh four during winter quarter so that all that they required i thinking about taking some extra anyway just because i like it that why i started it now i just like it anyway and i like their culture a lot um i ve been there twice already yep um both times i stayed around this little town uh it like northwest of munich so it southern um mossberg oh you know of those areas oh okay yeah yeah yeah it was little had a little gymnasium in it yeah um well the first time i went officially with the exchange program the second time i just went and the exchange program happened to be there at the same time but i didn go like under their insurance or on the same flight as them i just kind of met up with them it was more fun without being with without being with them yeah i could skip any program i wanted to yknow just show up at the parties basically um i like how everybody just a little more relaxed about stuff yknow like uh work hard when you have to yknow which when you should is a better way of putting it um and then when you don take it easy yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunch time because that the big meal of day you go home and eat with your family that really important and then um like people who work go back until like yknow maybe two to six um the kids are done with school for the day at like twelve one um hum oh yeah yeah you work really hard while you re at it and then when you re done you re done yeah and they re less hyper about like yknow bad things for people to do yknow the the drinking the smoking there not as strict about it basically i mean you you kind of suffer your own consequences more rather than having society like yell at you for it no they don actually um it kind of funny you re allowed to drink before you re allowed to drive so um there from what i hear one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person and had quite an experience with it i mean no crash or anything but was rather scared kind of shaken up by it but um no they re very very serious about designated drivers and um apparently when you re a car um they have a very very like zero tolerance for alcohol like on your breath at all yeah they do their trains are so cool i love those yeah they are yep yeah yep yeah they re they re really good about that um hum yeah they do i thought it was really cool we went hiking in the alps and somebody told us that um uh it all over they contract with dominion homes and dominion is seems like it going up everywhere and i so they re all over uh they have projects all over uh it not really an office he like a um supervisor that just goes to the different job sites he he tells the the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and and then he gets to um talk with the other contractors and he works together with them but he really just there a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites right yeah and they re all so different but he he deals real well with people so he really and he even thinking of going into uh business for himself yeah he almost doed that this year and then he thought nah i don want all the headaches so he like the top guy of wi with of the people that he works for so yeah yeah it be good though because i could take care to the books and everything and do all that kind of thing so um hum yeah yeah we probably eventually will do that but i like so up in the air about what i wanna do and there many things to do out there that i need to take time to think about it so no no i really don i ve done uh i ve done a variety of uh different things and then also um just reading and and things uh since i ve been off and i wante i wanted to go back to school i thought about that and i wanna do something with kids i almost thought of opening my own daycare center but then i didn know if i wanted to get into that and so just trying to take my time do what i wanna do yeah oh um yeah well and that good for the baby too yeah oh gosh i hate that really going around a lot well um let see i got divorced when my oldest was three and my youngest was about six months almost a year so i ve i ve raised them basically myself yeah so i did go back to work uh five years ago almost five years ago couple months short of that oh yeah i um well and that was really um struggle yknow a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work in secure jobs like that i mean you i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i say okay here we go yknow they re either gonna downsize or they re gonna do something and they always did so i was never really shocked and i didn panic or anything i was never without a job and never had to i never missed um yknow i would say it would take probably two weeks at the most before i would be working again yeah um hum yeah eighty four yeah um yeah pretty good for secretarial administrative type work i mean everybody always looking for that so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of different yeah i experience with um sexual harassment yeah real bad and and it was yknow mainly um no one talked about it yknow i mean it was just like and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else so you would never wanna yknow ever say anything but um yeah that i it well i walked out and uh it wasn quietly and i but it felt good and uh and i didn even know if i was gonna be living in the streets but i ll never forget the day yknow and his wife worked in the office too so i went to her and i said it was nice working with you i going home yknow can reach me at home and then he was shocked and he just couldn believe it and he said you can do this he says i won pay you and i said uh yknow watch me walk out the door and i don want any money yknow so i left out um oh it was just a a long drawn out thing i mean it thi started out with little things and then it just got bigger like um he had an office off of the main office and it was a pretty prominent uh insurance company and he had his own um agency and he was a successful i mean he probably still is out there very successful but i was doing some computer training and he was walking me to the other side of the building and he locked the door and turned around he said why don you get the first or the front door and it was only he and i in the office yknow and every once in a while his wife would be in there and i just i lost it i was i uh i was mad but i i didn want him to think that i was afraid i wanted to be of him to be afraid of me so i just i stomped back to my desk and i said oh i said not only are you a pain to work with i have to be afraid of you and then i think i did scare him because he start yknow he backed off a lot and just his personality and his his and then that that was a real um slap in the face for him so he was really mean after that so i left i just i walked out i picked the kids up at the bus stop and they re like mommy what are you doing i said we re going somewhere ki kids le get in the so but um yeah just couple experiences like that though make you do other things so yknow i stayed tough and i yknow got other jobs and was pretty good never had to borrow any money never went on welfare didn i think i was on food stamps or something for a month when i first yknow got a divorce so it been hard um uh he was in so much trouble and he was that was the main reason why i didn stay with him is he was just draining on me and pulling me down so he was never really there he was in and out of jail all the time and i would go through the whole um chuh bureau child support that whole thing and that was a total mess he have wasted all the time to go down there to court appearances and all this other stuff well it turned out he could just move he found out he could just move yeah so yknow he always got away from that oh yeah um hum yeah i think they re really helpful and i think that it the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there really but there so much fraud and there so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it yknow like with me i didn wanna stay on it i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i didn have the ambition that that i had i might have stayed home there like nine yknow there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to the her front step and she drove that year i mean she had a brand new yknow like whatever year it was that the car she had and i i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and yknow i thought yeah yeah yeah she probably got um i don know maybe even she sold drugs or yknow whatever kind of way she made her money but it wouldn have been enough welfare wise to get a car and to support the her living conditions or whatever um hum yeah yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for long time which yknow i sure she did i don know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you don pay a speeding ticket there a warrant for your arrest and they come after you yes mm hmm yep no mm hmm right yep oh wow um hum wow yeah no i ha we actually had student tickets that people didn want clear up in deck um but we enjoy it because lot times we walk and um i think i was at that penn state game i have a is a golf pro over near penn state trying think the name of it um but he usually gets us tickets for that game yeah mm hmm but i ve never been to happy valley i ve always wanted to go i ve heard it so nice and you they re such good people every time they come here to ohio state though they were very you know high class people and a year that we just killed them here i think it was three years ago and but they were yknow i mean though they just seem very gracious because i think their coach is the best joe paterno is the best i do he a he is he is mm hmm john no he he a very he a disappointment and i think the problem with this year was the coaching it good that they got rid of two coaches but his attitude i just don think the kids think of him as a role model and i think a coach has to be a role model i used to work at the hyatt on capitol square and that where the ohio state players i don know if you know this they stay there every night before a game i mean it the most expensive hotel in columbus all the players stay there but to my amazement they come down for a uh i think they have a dinner then they come down for a midnight snack it so funny all these guys come down in their shorts and stuff to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice but but then here comes the uh cooper wife and his daughter and like his son and i they re putting ah all these his family up in this hotel the before a game i mean i don know i just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when all none of those boys get to bring anybody you know what i mean and none of the other coaches did either um but i just thought it and here they came down for the midnight snack too and i thought this is for the team you know what i mean i thought it was very strange but um he seems pretty arrogant i don think he done very too much for columbus they need to get a younger coach they need a new they do because he just he all out for i just really think he is yeah i know it and then the players said we re not getting any guidance from the coaches you know and they some of them spoke out where they should speak out yknow mean i liked earl bruce and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at he was the nicest man and when they did that i don know if you know about that when they fired him the day before the michigan game for having a nine to three season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game and then but the whole band and the cheerleaders went to his house and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart wrenching and because of that the um um athletic director that was here at the time he quit because he did not want to fire them and they overruled him but the city just could not believe that they fired him like that the night before the michigan game so then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora yknow a hat he looked so cool yknow because joe paterno he always wears a tie i don know he just he he a great coach yknow not that what you wear makes you but he just he a good role model cooper just i just don see him ever hugging the guys or saying great job or anything you know right yeah um hum well the main thing is they never leave they don they go a lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest a of any college i mean that is an that is an embarrassment for a college this size and they have excellent professors and everything but i think yknow they get a lot of these kids and they don care about school but they they leave early because they know they can do it and that so sad for our city it really is yknow um hum um hum oh yeah and these guys have a free ride and then they just leave on it i know i think they should too i do i do i mean and you re right that not fair because then that that a waste um because there is some good athletes you look at colleges especially on the west coast like stamford i have a friend who from california his dad a um a graduate of stanford um but he is um they they never leave there i mean that an excellent medical school and everything but those football players they re smart they they don they don quit yknow i mean it amazing they they never do because they like it they like school and that why they came to college football was secondary but here it just to see yknow how much success you can have and then they just want to leave but we looked we can look forward to the basketball season i think he a good coach we needed that um hum yeah that was very exciting um hum yeah i think it was right um hum yeah i know well because yknow but then they have one injury and then what are they going to do and they got to think of that they have a free education and they just don think of it that way yknow they think they can make enough money but yknow money not everything it too bad sports have ended up this way it does um hum um hum i know um hum well i think all through growing up there always been yknow different kind of kids i mean there always been the nerds and um i don know when i was growing up in the seventies there really wasn punk or anything like that and i think um unfortunately i mean there always going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but it they just pushed you to an extreme certain kinds of kids and yknow they want a i saw yknow i watch all these shows dateline and twenty twenty and all this informative shows and how one was in texas run over one of the punk kids was run over by a um a jock i mean actually run over and killed um in a fight and they just said that we wanna be um looked at as just other kids yknow in high school but yet when they wear make up and they spike their hair and they have all these piercings yknow it like they ah they don want to be like everybody else yknow they want to be judged as like everybody else but yknow i think um they have so many different ideas and not that either one of them right but still um i i think there always going to barrier there they re just kids are just not all kids are going to get along yknow i mean i think because of the movies and i think of nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does spark things in little children minds and even yknow like in junior high that oh yeah we could do that yknow and there just so much violence in when we were growing up there wasn any violence on tv we weren allowed to watch it but yknow i mean i the comics weren violent um now it too open for kids the parents yknow they say the parents should monitor them i sitting here now scott i bet you on monday nights game tonight nine clock la la la so and so will win yknow and we don exchange any money or have any money figures planned out just yknow oh well that your team that my team lets go at it yeah and it makes it yknow fun so you can actually see what yknow your studying these teams does yknow you can go a whole season yknow seventeen eighteen and and nobody pretty much coming close to your standard and when you win all that money it just like yeah when you lose all that money it like that it i going home but i ve known people that gamble yknow compulsively i mean it like a gamblers anonymous level i couldn really get into that number one i not the richest person in the world and number two just little money here is one thing but when you re out there spending your car insurance money on it or rent money then you got a real problem there i ve seen guys do that to go down to scioto downs and bet the bet the farm on one horse and wouldn even do anything for them well you got the casinos river boat casinos open you got all the pretty much every store on the corners got a lottery machine or tickets i think it is a good idea because i ve won my fair share of money on the they give everybody a fair chance yknow they don just minimize it to one or two yknow some of them have options and some of them don yeah it just like uh having alcohol around mean gambling is a lot like alcohol it can be addicting it can screw your life up and you ll spend your last dollar on it if you re that far gone so pretty much anything can be one of those factors well most people think it something they rely on like well the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to schools on that issue then yeah i i agree with the gambling thing yknow just as long as it like social drinking in a sense because if you have people just go out like today i i bought a one dollar lottery ticket won two bucks off of it so i kept my one dollar and uh got a one dollar added on yeah there and then then there these um little bit more expensive cards you buy the lottery cards one of them called battleship that i ve won lot of money off of well you hafta it just like bingo numbers and you uh it just like the game battleship pretty much yknow a four a two a seven and um well off a three dollar one i ve won probably four out of five yknow in that i haven bought that many of them but in that race right there four out of fives not too bad got my mom one on her birthday she got fifteen dollars and the other times i get them i either win my three dollars back or i won nine dollars hm yeah yeah that could really bite you in the back though winning all that money i be well i be quite content with one million dollars but ten million dollars is kind of like over kill i mean do you think anybody in this town has ten million dollars well maybe a couple people couple of people yeah probably hafta go to dublin or yknow worthington somewhere around there to find couple millionaires but uh mm yeah give some charity and keep care of your bills and probably go on that vacation you been dying for like you re making my brain water here over australia well yeah it kind of like making your mouth water when you see food and this is my consent to let you use that yeah um hum i went to a lot of them i went middle school i went to clinton and indianola high school i went to brookhaven and fort hayes and well they re yeah one a alternative school and the other one just a regular trashy public school well this is about giving opinions and my opinion about the columbus public school system really isn good well because i ve been in public schools all my life and i should be first to know that there uh lot of favoritism yknow some some teachers will teach one but not teach the other well if yeah teach one person one thing and not teach the other person that kind of let me see here give an example there uh there a school that they showed on twenty twenty somewhere out west i believe it nevada or somewhere and they said that these uh teachers have the highest rating among many other teachers in the nation because of their actual sitting down and hands on critiquing these children like uh ex girlfriend of mine she was pretty much i wouldn put her borderline illiterate but she didn know how to read or write um hum okay it very difficult yeah i don know why uh columbus was just stubborn about it until the last year uh they hadn beyn able been able to get subs fifty perc substitutes fifty percent of the time and so the teachers were screaming and they were splitting the kids up and putting them in other classrooms well i don know if the parents made anything about it but i guess finally yknow when you have fifty percent of your classrooms uncovered uh they came to it and it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody the kids the principal or the other teachers but now it like oh thank you for coming oh thank you for coming so i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks i think a lot of the retired teachers who weren messing around with it have come back in so i don know exactly what to yeah well uh when i came uh back from oregon my father was very ill and so i didn want full time work and i started substituting out in uh licking county um ih which paid ch terribly low the there the there there all these little districts that has a superintendent well no they have two elementaries one middle school and one high school and a superintendent which they don need yknow so they hire straight out of college always and there there is a law that uh you have to pay for your accumulated time so i couldn get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me for so i came i back in to columbus and it a lot harder to work in columbus public but but um i i know the territory i know where i the population is much different yes well th you have uh you have an urban area with a lot of poor children uh a lot of single parent families and just the population is changing period from the uh the two parent family very the mother not working into one parent with the mother working it makes a big difference in how the child does at school yes it definitely having an effect on uh children and uh uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they aren doing it yet whether they will be able to pick up enough uh by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i don know but uh i glad my children went to school when they did and stayed home with them you should be real attentive to what happening in his school situation his or her yeah you should be we re all aware because the school has a big ha impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so yknow but you can tell how your child doing of course um hum at this point um i not ag uh i not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i wouldn mrv move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so uh such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they ve threatened it um and if they don pull their scores up um they will yknow no uh my opin uh well i um my opinion changes from day to day on whose fault it uh actually at this point in time i don know who fault it is uh i think it the fault of evolution well it could have been prevented but we didn know it was gonna happen that th that our society was gonna change so intensely and we kind of hung back and thought things would stay the same way they were and they haven and everybody changing and especially the younger people and uh we weren ready and we didn change fast enough we didn ready for the change that was coming columbus it seems to be i mean it just like blah i at this point i blame it on the administration um and the citizens of columbus haven i mean uh two years ago or was it three years ago now they defeated a levy you should never defeat a school levy yknow they never ask for extra money and uh they had to cut back on everything and i i think it just set people back now we re trying real hard to catch up and at some point we re going to um yknow have to put a levy on again and a and uh who knows what happen we re keeping rosa smith right now because she so good with the with the business community but the business community in columbus doesn really support the schools i they don i mean we ve got two new uh stadiums and we haven got any increase in school funding go along with what my father thinks and says and if he wants it a certain way why you just don question that and i just don do that it wrong um hum um hum right right he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and not speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please nanc i changed my name when i went to college i just decided i out of here i everything gone and so she would say um nancy please just talk to your father just for just for my sake please ta and i would think i the child here i shouldn have to be the one to make peace in this family if he doesn wanna talk to me i don need him i don have to talk to him yeah right right yknow yeah yeah yeah i shouldn have to do this i not responsible for the happiness of this family and the fact that i recognized all that and couldn wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my fam in fact i ve been happy about them lately because um i ve well we ve lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents say they live in florida they um i mean they re not well to do by any means but they they re not lacking for anything and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year to they spend a week with my brother etc etc and they come here a couple times a year and they stay at my sister house they have only come to my home three times in twenty years and that because they don wanna get off the freeway they will drive through columbus from florida to go to visit people in in akron and masillon and they stay in cincinnati and they stay in springfield with my sisters and they won do it because it just to mu they don wanna have to deal with that traffic they don like that and it and just recently i finally said yknow i don understand why you can do that yknow i ve actually called them i fifty two you would think by now yknow this wouldn matter and my youngest daughter when i was crabbing about it because i said i talked to them and they said well we re coming to ohio in a couple weeks and i said oh good are you gonna come and see us um well no we weren we weren planning on it and i said well why well we re we re not driving uh doty renting us the car well all that meant was my sister was renting the car but he was driving the car yeah i said well well well then how are you gonna get to these other places and normally i wouldn do that i would just let it go well uh uh uh doty renting that car and i said well are you aren you driving it well well yeah but and i said fine and i don wanna even think about it so it kind of like it just bizarre um hum right and why what he he too busy yeah he doesn have the ti mine don have the time but they but then in the very next breath they said well in two weeks we re going to california to visit paul now now and anyhow i was telling each of my children because i was upset and i was telling them this and they re all going oh mom my older girls are going oh yknow and my my daughter who thirteen is fabulous she is so blunt she is such she just so out there and so different from so many other children um and she said well do you actually care if he comes here you don care do you and i said well i don care but it makes me feel bad it hurts my feelings uh i should know i i don really care why should i yeah but it but you still just think because i thinking too so what happens when they die am i gonna be feeling bad that this and i but i can my sister said look yknow you re not gonna change and i not the reason he won come to my house is because when he goes to their house everything changes they have to have dinner at ten clock in the morning we re not doing that we re gonna compromise and we ll do it at one clo we ll do it at noon we have dinner at seven clock at night right we ll do it at noon i not doing it at ten clock in the mor i don care and there no compromise with him you have yeah whatever you want sure right so they don come see me and i guess i shouldn care because i i would just like them actually what i like them is come for about twenty minutes so they can see this wonderful home we have that all i care about i just wanna show it off yknow it like look you always think i could yknow look i doing really well look how wonderful everything is and wouldn you like them to see that yknow look i re really really and it bizarre um hum um hum um hum um hum right yeah aw yeah i know i know i know i mean i sort well that just it that part of it because like i see my parents wouldn come my mother used to try to come to things at school when i would be in different things and and i really did apprec but my father would not he just wou wouldn she say well you know he just doesn like that kind of thing i mean i would be in the sunny spelling bee i would be in the he he doesn well too damn bad get your butt down there and pretend like you like it and so yknow with our fa and my husband the same way his family was exa his father died when he was nine he was like the adult in his family he came from a buffalo new york working class he left he never looked back either and so it kind of like he and i are bo people always they say yknow how we re such i i don know we get a the schools are always so grateful to us because we organized the state chess tournaments he started the baseball league for this building yknow he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff and it simply because we re so grateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids lives and to go to everything i mean he coaches baseball he coaches yknow um basketball we don miss anything yknow it doesn matter what it is we re because we wanna be because it a privilege not because oh i gotta go to another play yknow my daughter just did a play downtown with columbus junior theater and i ushered at eighteen performances because i could see it free i i didn wanna pay ten bucks every time to see it but if i ushered i could be in the audience every time yknow and for my parents to have no interest in seeing seeing play baseball or swims for ohio wesleyan yknow or in a play they they wouldn they don even wanna be bothered with that that just to them it just and i can understand that yeah yeah yeah yeah oh it ll be sure sure yeah exactly right um hum uh huh timer yeah uh huh right right right yeah i know oh it gives me goose bumps it such a shame i know and isn it amazing and yeah right i know and yknow and the thing is you re gonna have a a great time with your kids and it just it it it almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have it like this it worth it yeah yeah it just it just wonderful i know like saturday we re gonna drive to oberlin to watch swim two events and come back so yeah she says mom i only gonna be in the water five minutes total why are you guys driving to oberlin ohio for this because we wouldn miss it there ll be a time when we well you know she won be doing those things so it it just important and it wonderful and i just think it just such an opportunity i so lucky to be able to do that see now like my husband i eleven years older than he is yeah it depends on what area you live in too the area where i live in you get little house because you re close to everything whereas you get kind of farther away from the center of the area you can get a bigger house and there some really really pretty ones yeah and um the en the uh smaller house like bigger squished in areas are uh the older area and then as the community fanned out then they had bigger houses i like living in the old area better i like the houses in the new area better there one in particular that just gorgeous they have this entrance and there are these trees on the inside of the house they re just growing down into everything and there are like crystals and they have this one room that looks like a sphinx and then they have um this backyard that looks all yknow cute old england it really really cool house has this little bridge that goes up to the front door and a creek i mean it um yes some of the guys from venturing crew live there yeah we did we had a um they called lan parties they are parties where everybody takes their computer and you hook em up to into a network and then you play games yknow we had one of the parties up there and they had this um big like pyramid shaped thing i i forget what they call it it like a crystal something i don know but they have a speaker hook up to it and the structure of it makes the sound resonate like crazy they have subwoofers sitting under it and there this bed in the middle so i ended up falling asleep there one night somebody woke me up with the music ah oh it yeah it definitely weird it really cool yeah yeah very new age um hum got a few ideas um i thinking i might be a just they need a lot of women in that field yknow they needs good people there um the money didn hurt just it good money yeah um one idea that i ve just had recently is medical informatist which is a person who has an and does computers since those are my two main interests i thought doing both would be really cool and i meeting with someone on thursday actually who in that field it really just an open field yeah uh it it is where bioinformatics was about a year or two ago just really starting to get started and i mean somebody you have an that enough yknow you want somebody who has computer skills as well that difficult to find yeah the other way around is probably even harder it does yeah you just see like all the different kinds i think even if i don want to go into it yknow rotations in every single area will be interesting like i shadowed in the uh psych ward last week and that was really interesting and i have feeling i gonna love my rotation but i don want to be a psychiatrist no as for it was kind of disturbing actually yeah yeah i saw the patients in the morning yep oh yeah yeah oh um well i thought about being a medical scientist with they do um research like um with applications to medicine but more in the biochemistry field or genetics or something like that that that would be seriously fun but uh it depends if you work industry you get money if you work at a college or a hospital you make no money yeah pretty much it seems like it i i wanted to for a long time now i just not so sure that i want the two or three more years of school they suggest two to three years for your like i don wanna do that too much um yeah that what they suggest doing is two years of med school get your and then do your last two years of med school and then you do your residency you don have to do a residency but if you ever wanna go clinical you have to do it yeah yeah just ridiculous amounts of stuff i like i don wanna do that yeah yeah i would be at least thirty maybe looking uh towards forty before i have the experience really necessary to get into good jobs like i don wanna be i mean like my uh venturing crew advisor is thirty eight and retired i mean i i going more for there um a lot of good investments a lot of saving a lot of living well below means and i wanna own six businesses yeah um his definition of retired is basically um he doesn have to work he does but he doesn have to so he just finished up a temp job up at uh qwest yep i think he gets paid like three seventy five an hour now yeah that how he gets so much money he says i will be paid this much and i will be given this many um had this much minimum per day or i not working for you and they usually say no no no we won do that yknow and then they ll call back a week later okay we ll take you he has some really good stories about that oh yeah he has qualifications businesses and also with uh unix which is um i don know do you know anything about unix okay yeah he does i think he specializes in like solaris and and yeah he says he knows the as well but he doesn like to do it so he doesn do it yeah he teaching us uh system five it just okay um it like two now okay huh i wonder if that also socialized medicine there it is socialized isn it yeah yeah my best friend lives in on outside canberra and she has a lot of medical problems but huh they re covered but it was real tricky because she sort of had some of she was a citizen she fell in love through email over the internet back in the early like nineteen ninety it was real early and went over there and married the guy and so she had some of the medical problems when she emigrated and uh it was just it took years to get that straightened out but she covered now hm it medicare type thing yeah and as more and more people are getting older and older there be more need for it it be a lot of things there gonna be more need for as people get older tests uh yeah yeah well and i think chiropractors will be more popular for the same type of reason yeah huh i uh i ve gone to one but i had a back problem that how dealt with it and it worked the same thing yknow i think they re terrific for the right things yeah oh okay oh you don ask an easy one do you that a that really yeah that i mean that really a tough one uh because it i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer um and yknow i don think it violence on tv i don think it working parents i think it and i don know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved easily um i don know it a tough one and i mean your daughter uh you said daughter yeah is still young so you have to deal with but is scary you send your kid to school and you hear these things and it just no matter where it is in the country or the world you hear of it yknow really worries you i very much in favor of gun control very strong gun control um i it they just seem to be too available but then some of the things that the schools are doing about it know the kid who comes to school with a paper gun gets suspended that a little much but i don know i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out and was threatening kids with it and so they suspended him yeah uh it it to me that sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you ve done it what the kid did and you don want him to do it again and let it go they suspended him i don know course um i probably say this i got this version of the story from the columbus dispatch so it probably not the whole story yeah it it is well and if you want something local that all you got i mean there one paper i don even read it much it very conservative very republican yeah then there probably columbus it it it the democrat yeah franklin county usually votes differently than the rest of at least the metropolitan areas of the state yeah oh okay yeah i well and it not just in the schools it in society i mean violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things and i it i i just can i it it hard to imagine that the there an easy fix if there is a fix i it kinda frustrating because you can point to one thing and say this is what needs to be fixed yknow it pervasive it like the i don know if you ve heard about this in the news a woman two of them were having an argument and one of one of them set fire to the other one it was real close to my home it the grocery we yeah no i haven been over there since then yeah but it like i mean you there these stories almost everyday you hear them and that i mean that even a big change from five or ten years ago or maybe it well or maybe it crime that going down in the sense that it supplying yknow it criminals aren as active but there more and more of these acts of violence maybe it because they re so dramatic that you notice it yeah yeah i mean maybe break ins are down or holding up seven elevens are down but then you hear these yknow murders and then they seem like random or just spontaneous there no way wa nothing you can do in life to really avoid it except hide in your basement or something and that yknow and that not a life right and you got it walking down the street yeah uth there seems to be an awful lot of publicizing some of it i mean some of it pretty dramatic a woman setting fire to somebody what happened in columbine it very dramatic but when it happened in columbine it was all that was on the for a whole day i see seemed like you anywhere you looked that where it was thing loose a little there uh and that all you could see and it was like well how much do how much new is there to say from minute to minute on every channel how much do people really need to keep hearing it and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lotta places they pick something that sensational keep they re making it even more sensational like when john kennedy died fortunately we were out we weren in the country so we didn know so we had heard just well we were uh we weren that far we were in vancouver so it not that far away we didn hear about it for a couple days but i heard that that all that was on every aspect of his life every aspect of the search did people really need to know that do they need to have it driven and i think in ih and i think at that point that where the media are just they re sensationalizing it oh everyday there was something it like i felt felt like i knew more about clinton sex life than i knew about my own yknow it about and it was far more then i wanted to know about anybody else where as yknow in the past there been presidents who had affair the press never even acknowledged it even if they knew it i mean at least that what ya you re really smart no you re not dumb but they sit in class and they see their friends just catch on to things and that they can do and so then they say well my parents are just saying that because they love me i really stupid yknow and you have to actually ow them when they get to be this age that look you have a hundred and seventeen i so that means you re a good problem solver you re a good logical thinker you re good in science you re good at math yknow so there a few things you re not good at doesn mean you re stupid yknow i much rather be stranded on an island with six kids than with six normal kids because kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry yknow oh yes they are well generally they have some area i don think i ve ever met the kid yet the kid who has no area that he doesn excel in like once i had a sixth grade girl who still didn know her time tables in sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice and in every single school production she was the lead singer i had a girl once that won all kind of medals in gymnastics at the state level it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back i ve had kids who they got every badge you can get in boy scouts and yknow i mean there usually something that they re really it might not be related to school but there usually something that they re really really good at in some other area like there swimming or or scouting or whatever so they yknow but generally speaking they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with much more creative solutions than the normal person with a hundred or ninety five i now i ve seen them long to know that and worked with them long enough to know that well like i have one boy who can spell them he still spells it i and he took my computer apart the other day and adjusted something in the mother board and put it back together now it works now i mean if you saw his writing you think a cave man wrote it it looks like hieroglyphics or something but i want something done with my printers or my computers i just go hey jared i having trouble with this printer takes it all apart fixes it i mean he really oh yeah well that the other thing they re a lot of times they re good in the arts they re either an artist i ve a boy right now that an eighth grader that painting a huge canvas for me for my living room because i haven been able to find a picture so i brought in the picture and he enlarging it and painting it for me in his free time and it gonna go in my living room and i mean it it me i mean he really quite the artist in music arts um literature acting i ve had kids that ve been like really top notch actors in the school plays i it it just not necessarily a school kind of thing that they re gonna be good at but i try to explain to the parents that just because your child learns differently is no reason to think they won be successful in life mark spitz won an olympic gold medal he has a learning disability cher bono can remember a phone number without transposing two of the numbers and she says that herself um einstein didn learn to read until he was twelve um winston churchill he stuttered until he was like seven or eight uh walt disney was told by a manager at woolworth that he would never have a creative idea in his life and fired him um beethoven i think it was beethoven that didn talk till he was like seven they thought he was retarded but you see these people just they re brain wired differently than ours is and you just you can ever expect them to approach any problem like you would because they won it just doesn seem logical to them they re usually real good at puzzles they re usually real good at yknow things that manipulatives things that don take words things that you just hafta solve by just manipulating things around yeah some of them are pretty good at that some of them aren too some of them like when you have them copy uh like up from this box down to this box these little shapes in a certain amount of time if their visual perception is messed up they screw that all up they yknow the form goes this way they draw it this way their brain flips it around on them that why they have trouble with and and and and they re still reversing yknow you ma my normal kids that goes away about age eight my kids they re still doing it yknow they re still ma or they might make an eight from the bottom up instead of from the top down or a six from the bottom up i even had a kid once that made ones from the bottom up you could tell by watching them write that their brain didn work like yours did well that yeah you well usually normal kids that that yeah it developmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school it becuth because that sat because that when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they found out that the full dominance doesn take over till about age eight you have a preference at five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemispheres is pretty much decided it gonna be the one that runs the show well then that when those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture so hm oh no i thought my son the one that eighteen now i thought he was gonna be left handed up like four because his dad left handed my sister left handed i have one left handed parent well all of sudden one day he picked up the thing with the right hand and he been wri writing with his right hand ever since so you really can tell because they they re pretty much either or until they re about five and you don have to worry if she writes her name backwards like a mirror image yknow because that ll all go away about second grade oh good i always hate it when people name their kids jamilia kenisha and i like oh boy is this kindergarten teacher gonna have fun with this little girl i i always think you should name a kid i have opinions about everything see i think you should name a kid something that will fit him at eighty three and eight and in between like we named our son robert so when he was little he was robbie now he eighteen he rob when he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do he can be robert paul yknow and in kindergarten all he had to learn to write was or so that it yknow i have a hard time picturing an eighty three year old woman as a tammy for example so you should name her tamara and call her tammy when she little and then she can be called tam yknow when she in her middle years and tamara when she yknow but yknow i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing it the one thing in life we get to do where there no restrictions no laws nobody gives you any limitations or parameters they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it yeah over that right and i uh i say you should look what we did is we look in the newspaper and we found the top ten boys and the top ten girls names that have been the most popular for the last fifty years and we pick out of those because otherwise your kid gonna hate you emma sort of a timeless name in that it it yknow been around for a long time yet people don associate it with old women because there are still emma today i mean right and i mean it it a easy to spell it easy to say and yknow i it you can shorten it to em or but um some names are just like we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they didn ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and her mother name was harriet and i like how can you go gitchy gitchy goo harriet doesn seem right harry yeah like oh my god what did we do like my grandmother name was olive when i was born my dad said why she looks just like your mother to my mom and i ve turned out to do everything that she did i ve turned out to teach she was a teacher i ve turned out to be yknow real good in the kitchen and baking and i do like crafts like she did knitting and crocheting and i do that but i sure glad they didn name me olive oh yeah herb the herbs the herbs yeah it a qualitative type ah analysis exactly yeah they re very quantitative as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is all about bottom line and the numbers because actually that why i don like like i like business and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i can not stand because they honestly they re like oh it doesn matter how you treat people and then it all about the bottom line well they ll en in my they ll end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire a new employee and if you have constant turnover things like then and if you have a product and that because obviously people aren gonna yknow so and they they re they seem very closed minded like like this is the way business has to but the professors don seem to be necessarily like that maybe i coming too far going to one extreme but the professors seem more center centered to me they re like you have to balance it which i sure is the truth yknow you can diminish all your bottom line yknow making your workers good but there still something to it i think yeah exactly see i not sure if universal health health care would be th the thing i think it was my freshman year my sister and i went to donna shale the the whitehouse like on she high up i guess i was un unaware yeah she she had a talk and my sister and i attended and i don like the problem i think with universal healthcare would be everyone don you think like everyone with the littlest scratch would go in yknow a as opposed like the very mu and ne i think that could drive costs up so there has to be a way to balance it i not sure how you would go about doing that because you don wanna a limit and say okay you only go three times a year because then yknow what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i i at least for children especially because they have no to to help themselves and like the obviously even if they re working a lot of times can get healthcare for their children so i think at least for children because how many accidents happen to children like people are always breaking arms and stuff yknow and without health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars and they have no means to help themselves at least if you assuming you re eighteen you get a job like and try and for your health insurance i mean it i not saying it be easy but still it more feasible than a six year old yknow so i think maybe not universal health care but for children i think it be helpful yeah exac medicaid i think i think it i it it they re always synonymous but but they re uh because they re both government programs but yeah but i like i said for the for the younger people because it is ay because it not their fault their parents can get health care so oh really oh really oh i see well that be a good way i would think yeah yeah then the there be desire yeah yeah that seems good that cool yeah that uh the the bureaucracy it be too much of a struggle i think yeah but if you re the first state in the union to do it it co it ll cost you and millions it would be rough it be so hard to i know exactly you would but i don know there has to be something like you know the first state tha do that does it i mean aa i after one i sure others would follow suit it after they see the of it but that first one i don and it would take like years i would think to implement the programs successfully government doesn seem to work too swiftly no not not that i ve seen yknow because honestly like gore to me is like a out of a bad bunch if i have to choose i ll choose gore but that doesn mean i necessarily like he most in line with a lot of my stu with a lot of my views no don get me wrong i not completely liberal on everything like there certain things i guess maybe because going to school in ashland it just rubs off on you there certain things i not so liberal about but i don really like gore just seems so dry and just not it hard to i it be hard to get people enthusiastic for him no not at all i would ve rather voted for over bush because bush he comes from a political family which i not saying is wrong because the kennedys were a big political family but i saying like bush is um he just seems like he didn really like ih everything been handed to him in life the issue of like whether he did drugs not that that a big issue but i don like the way he addressed it yknow that to me if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he handling it saying i not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over if he didn do it he might as well just be like no i didn do it yknow because then what does he have to hide and then like the fact that he didn know like i in international policy he ll be struggling if he becomes president he didn know the leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage an entire yknow an entire economy i th think yeah and that like i don tha that state notorious for killing people i think they killed someone last night that to me is like that ridiculous like the governor he could ve made a stay or yknow what i mean and they ve openly admitted that they ve killed people that were found to be innocent later yeah and it like number one in the union and that like such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone life and be like oh our bad that person was innocent yknow tha definitely i definitely the way i feel the death penalty wrong but i don know are always like oh you know if your mother ih if your mother was killed god forbid but like you would want the death penalty but honestly i don think i would i really like i feel angry towards that person but killing them doesn help with maybe the families say it helps with closure and everything but i eh that to me it displacing my anger in a way that actually i don think my victim that i was so close to me would want me to do yknow so well like i a philosophy minor like if you look at like different ethical theories and stuff yo like there a hierarchy kind of this is what i ve found there a hierarchy of things that are uh like the inalienable rights for instance like i can if you come into my house and rob me and then run outside i not i don don like to kill you for stealing my property like there a hierarchy there uh for stealing another life that why people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like there nothing like if i if it inalienable the definition is it not able to be taken not even by yourself that why you can commit suicide and since it the highest thing because without it you can even do the others it so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can do the you can be ethical in any other so that has to be the highest thing and if it inalienable because i didn give it to you i can take it back you never forfeited that you never gave me that right that why i feel like i could want that in a to kill another person or an well yeah uh under certain yeah well it it uh we took uh i took military ethics as a philosophy course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that hierarchy there still certain contexts within the context of war for instance if if we both if we knowingly go into it as combatants and we we we re fighting for whatever cause but if we both are willingly going into it well yknow it because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i sure i sure that i didn pay more than three thousand on it and it yknow it didn cost me more than three thousand and so if i had five or six thousand dollars out of it i was happy i mean ah i mean that that a lot of money for having a good yknow so i almost bought one um uh bla couple weeks ago in fact i went i went into contract on it with this guy this dear old man whose it was for his mother who was in her nineties in a retirement home was on royal forest which is north and i made this this low offer and i never thought that they would i didn want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i if i was gonna get this house i should get it but i didn really want now because of the baby coming and we re gonna be busy and i didn wanna get involved in and so i made this offer and then he back yknow i offered him ninety and he was asking ninety nine nine so he countered back at ninety six and i said that and yknow i thought well good now i don worry about he never gonna come to it so i wrote back and said yknow i appreciate your offer but ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was really the only thing i could i could do and i didn even give him a time to respond because i just just assumed i was just bowing out of it i checked my fax machine the next day it says my mother has decided accept your offer and i thought shit i don this what am i gonna do now so i ended up talking him and i i just explained to him that um he caught me off guard and that i had more time to reconsider it and that because of and it true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said that that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not gonna work for me he a nice man i felt bad and so then i gave him ideas about how he could sell it to help him well i always assume you be running it that whole time i mean i see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were gonna buy house in clintonville to hold them and rent them my problem is i don have any money so i that down has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple condos over on bethel road it for my kids to live in so that my oldest girl when she getting ready to move out she like twenty four and sh they couldn find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable i finally decided well we ll find something and i ll buy and i ll be your land lady and then what ll it ll be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was gonna move out when she graduated from high school and changed her mind so i just rented that one but it the bottom line is i i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work with that helped me buy those without any money i didn have a down payment i had nothing so so it like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment but the other you would you would be fine you be renting it you wouldn buy anything that you didn think you could rent and come out even with um hum it gotta be hard if you haven had other projects uh huh yeah wow yeah yeah right right yeah you re right it right i keep think oh i wanna go back and some classes yknow i keep thinking i go back to school but i can even narrow down what i would wanna there so much stuff there so many areas that are interesting to me yeah oh i know yeah right that exactly how i am when you said what would i do yknow i might do house i might do go to school some i used to own a gallery i might do something like that again yknow there just like there just zillions of projects out there waiting to happen and so it just it was we had a little gallery um we were in clintonville for a a year or so and then we moved to grandview and it was just fine art we called it fine art crafts and it was handmaid stuff from local and we had lot of jewelry and pottery and silk and paintings that kind stuff it was it was fun i met a lot of neat in fact that where i met the woman whose child i took care of she was one the artists who came to me it but it was not nobody was gonna make any money on it and it was the kind of thing that it was a project i started it when my youngest daughter started kindergarten because i needed a new project and i didn know anything about it i never even been in a gallery i thought uh this ll be fun i ll just rent this space because i found this space and i was trying think of something i could do with it so i thought well i ll rent this space then ah i know what i ll do i ll just put an ad in the paper and i ll find a bunch of artists and then i ll set this business up so and it was consignment so i didn needed that money i just needed rent and we had art classes and that was fun and so once i got that whole thing all set up and all ready to go it not nearly as interesting once yknow you i like i like to make it i not really interested in just sitting there day after day waiting for somebody to come and so when the lease was up on high street i was gonna get rid of it and a couple people came to me that were artists there and said could we yknow would you consider having some partners and i said sure if you guys are willing to come and sit in this place and i don come sit here so we moved to grandview and it was doing much better over there then the same happened attorneys who were next door to us decided they wanted our space and when our lease was up they had more money than we did so we were gonna have to move and i just said this is not worth it and that i was ready that was about three four years into it i was ready to do else and i had already started taking care of jesse then so i used to take him down to the gallery with me and i had a little bassinet in the and people say is a baby yeah you just find it i can do anything i want do you see i don care at all about tra i don even drive but go on uh huh you need uh huh uh huh right it just challenge to figure out how to make something work or how to i just incredibly optimistic i mean i really feel like um whatever happens to me i really it it my responsibility to yknow help it happen take care of it deal with it yknow i but i have a backup yknow or whatever going on i always have to have a backup plan though and then i know well if this happens this ll and if doesn happen this way then is what we ll do instead uh huh does your husband like that oh mine drives him crazy oh yeah yeah that true sure uh huh uh huh oh yeah uh i not i haven learned to stop myself too much yet i i ih i think we have this this thing of um logistics and in efficiency and it kind of like okay now let see if you if you if this is what has to happen wi we we re able to order the sequence of like i see people doing things like and it has to do with driving thing too like driving from place to place to place to place to place to place for so i mean why the hell don you and find out if they even have it yknow decide where you re going why do you just waste all your time running around like that i know it ever forever yknow and another thing is are the friends of mine are always yknow could you take my business for me like like could i do their checkbook course i not gonna do their checkbook but just like to show them how to keep in because i have a real good sense of yknow how things have to be and it just my husb and i are very different we re just we re very different but we have we re really lucky we have fabulous relationship and yknow and he real grateful and appreciative and he said as long as he appreciates yknow like he ll come home and okay well i didn know if you give them my name yeah if you can no it easier than trying to call up i will even went to the they got a food one over here by the vet clinic i went one day to eat my lunch all the time for two weeks and they paid me ten dollars a day well it beats getting a second job yep half tank gas oh i know they don care they got money people that got them they could care less yeah that because their parents are rich i used to work at baker believe me i know yeah okay yeah meet people i ve lived lived in columbus all my life uh my dad dead he been dead about twenty five years my mom still alive she not in real good health my wife moved from columbus to arizona and then she moved back here and we got married uh said i grew up here i used to hunt fact is you know where henderson olentangy and bethel road i used to hunt all up in through there yeah that was all woods and everything back and nobody wanted even live up in there it was trash area yeah you gotta remember it was all swamps back when i was a kid uh like i said i grew up down here it was mostly farmlands when i grew up around here and stuff uh because i used to go from henderson down to lane avenue and i hit one light on olentangy that was it yeah well it got a lot worse uh when i say a lot worse because if yknow you say you don have kids i got a kid twenty three years old and there was no place for him to play basically you know we used to be able to go to the woods and everything else now you don even see merry go rounds on the playground because people would sue over it no offense people are ridiculous uh yeah i got a and then he got a son so i guess i a grandfather i i hardly ever see em but that because i not home a lot and like i said my wife here now mom just moved to texas so she living down in texas and she got brothers and sisters all over the united states yeah uh i trying to figure out what else to tell you i ve worked here at the university uh twenty four years before that i worked at uh channel four tv station for about five years so i started work when i was fourteen and i ve been working ever since i ve been out of school since i was sixteen so i i was in the service i was in vietnam uh is there anything else you need to know or well i used i used to fish and stuff like that but i ve had skin cancer i ve had four heart attacks and if you look at my skin now you see all the blisters and stuff on i can even go out in the sun that long i ve had melanoma cancer and stuff so i sold my boat now mainly my hobby is uh just tinkering around and stuff fix i ll buy a car fix it up and sell it or something like that just for something to do uh trying to retire here from the university so i can get more hobbies well see i a limited on some of the stuff i like to do i like to well i like to go back and working with my hands and stuff i used to do maintenance uh there ain nothing i can fix you know that not because i skilled or anything it because well when i was a kid my dad was crippled i had to fix everything so yeah so basically i learned with him yelling at i heard do this do that but ah everybody in my family mechanically inclined uh she disabled uh she got she in a car accident she got what called myrofacial pain syndrome or something like that it from she had spiral meningitis when she was a kid and it was brought on because of that and plus she got a glass eye so she very limited on working in closed corners and stuff like that uh so she basically disabled and that goes when they do that it because of your education and also they take into consideration and everything so she mas mainly stays at home she uh has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that with her eye or the car accident car accident i say about ten years ago no she lost her eye when she was six playing cowboys and indians with her brother she a cowboy and he was an indian yeah it was a homemade bow and arrow which every kid in the world plays with i sure you played with it too no well you always hear about the gun yknow uh basically last time i heard he was doing lawn care he done about everything like i told him yknow get as many jobs as you can until you figure out what you wanna do he done uh maintenance work he done ah sales work i said he doing lawn care now he done uh gardening uh his girl friend they ve lived together he not married like i said he got a kid now they ve been together for about four years but uh a lot times he ll work for her dad now he does a lot of maintenance he was doing dry wall before this i kinda wish he stuck with that that like twenty five or thirty an hour but uh the company wanted him to move to florida and he didn wanna move so now he back into lawn care until something else better comes along yeah don bother me one bit no because i know people that are married don take care their kids he takes care of his so to me that more important uh i was only there for couple weeks in the harbor i never set foot on land no i was in the marines but uh basically all we did was just go back and forth uh from like philippines to vietnam then from uh vietnam to hong kong from hong kong to vietnam uh we were floating around just they didn know if they were gonna send us in or not because it was toward the end of it i not that old yet i might look two years uh i got thrown out of high school uh because i wasn allowed to wear jeans i wasn allowed to wear tennis shoes course everybody else could but basically what it was uh was a weird situation in high school uh it was for me and a couple other people and that was it and it i you know any the more strict you make it the more they rebel and i was one of type of people i was a mean kid yeah uh yeah they uh got me one time for cutting zero period and the principal was having me sit in the office during zero period to serve detention so like if you can tell me how they can get me for cutting class when they ordered me to sit in the principal office i couldn figure that one out too well at the time when they were having a lot of trouble at school and they just wanted to get rid of some people yeah yeah i was sixteen when i got out of high school and then i took my at seventeen and passed it plus was i went in marine corps at seventeen it was probably the best thing for me because i well i met a lot more different cultures seen how a lot more different people live and found out how lucky i was yknow when you go over there and see people begging for can of beans and then you come here you know what i mean you see people standing out on street corners with signs work for food i feel like i should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting behind yknow yeah and people don don realize it and plus the mental health aspect of it and everything and some of that controlled with medication now but not all of it because they because of the drug and alcohol they won put him on some of the medications so but as far as i can tell he been pretty clear and clean on that end uh yknow like once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she taking very good care of herself she uh she lately has been going with him to the psychologist and oh uh we ve been paying for it but we don have a problem with that because he he likes the psychologist so took a long time to get to that point but uh so we ve been talking to the psychologist about it and he said this should be she he said most people that raised in that background he said they go two different ways ones they they just fall into the same uh pattern as their parents or they re survivors she appears to be a survivor uh she never really had what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us uh which i glad uh and she we really like her she really it we enjoy being with her but sometimes more than being with my son uh so it it been very difficult for us particularly the last four years and about the time he ran away was er between the time my father in law died and my mother in law died which was in a five month period so my wife had an awful lot to deal with um she had a lot to deal with in that time yeah yeah plus a lot of work stress that she had and stuff uh she works at franklin university she assistant vice president there so there been a lot of pressure there every time she thinks she got it fully staffed and everything covered somebody quits but uh and that what the main problem been yeah i retired about uh four years ago from the state i worked there for thirty years actually i started working for the state when i school here i worked here and that counted those five years counted towards retirement so i was able to retire early and then the last uh about the last two and a half years i ve been working the symphony in the box office started part time and then i was full time for a while and then i requested to be cut back to part time again because uh i don need to work that many what i i right i didn need to so i didn want to uh i fifty two yeah i was forty eight when i retired so it great it terrific uh uh all those years and after i left at school here i was at the bureau of employment services i worked for about uh twenty years with uh research and statistics labor market information uh federal state programs collecting information on three different programs in that time then i worked for about a year and a half on a special project uh they were automating the employment services activities and they were going in a complete different der direction to match um job needs of employers and applicants to to get more placements for interviews and that sorta thing and i developed that method the the mechanism that check lists and stuff i did uh worked on that uh and i worked for the last three years in jobs training uh for economically disadvantaged youth adults and dislocated workers the uh technical assistance and policy end of it and hated it the other years were fine but those last three were pretty bad uh oh yeah and they are actually offered an early retirement because the funds i don re you may not remember about three years ago four years ago the the federal government was not gonna pass a budget and all this stuff so when that doesn happen on budget cuts in at seventy five percent of what the previous year budget was or something like that which was more money than they were gonna give us before that uh so they had to they would either have go lay off people or offer retirement so i took the retirement because i was not happy there anyway so then took couple months off and did some consulting was worked on a consulting project at a borden for about six months then when that project ended just same time it ended my father in law was diagnosed terminally ill with cancer and he needed daily treatments here in columbus and they don they were from chilicothe so uh i became his caregiver for about three months till he died and then took a couple months off and started working part time at the symphony have been since then answered an ad in the paper uh but i ve sung in a well shawn sings in the symphony chorus too i ve sung in it for sixteen years um so i just you know was something i was a little familiar with anyway uh i was just looking for something part time so it worked out well it is really is it it really is great i just haven enjoyed it you re right yeah before that i was fine if i ever still it if i i made a mistake by applying for that one job i just wanted to get something different because i didn wanna go back where i was well i would ve been better off back where i was i would ve been better at the job for one thing and i knew uh knew th kind of insanity i be dealing with there oh uh yeah yeah i applied for it and went after it aggressively uh i was good in the i mean i knew what i was doing i kind of wish i hadn been as prepared but uh but it was a lot of the peop i moved into a management position i was in it was a lateral move wasn even a pay raise or anything it was a lateral move and the people that i was supervising some of them been doing it for twenty years and they made it very clear to me that they knew the program and i didn and uh and you know i was there for three months before i got hit with a uh uh ra discrimination suit and but then i found out later this woman had in the twenty years she been there had filed twenty suits so you re in there flying and you re turning and you re putting your flaps down and i go six nine eight juliet uh say your altitude and you re like um di did they call me yknow because you have a lot of things going on and i not i i i mister laid back in that area had a lot of people go i don see how you can be so calm but yknow i always look at it though as yknow i can scare you to death and you ll never come back to columbus or any airport that has a tower or i can be nice to you and you can go out and spread the word that yknow there there some people there that are pretty yknow so i figure it it much better to be nice to them because there also times when yknow everybody makes errors and yknow maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh yknow like there an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way and i really meant for you turn left instead of right and you may come back and go uh do you do you mean left or right there and i go yes that is correct turn left yknow he so yknow everybody helps everybody out yknow i i feel kindness goes a long way and the pilots the same way the they mo most most often they re yknow pretty decent no i don i just got too expensive yeah i ve never i ve never known of him we don know who in the airplane and there but there are planes that do come in and out of there very often i mean maybe like there like one or two that come during the year but yeah i don yeah yeah yeah now if you the the the thing you do is if you know the call sign and you know about what time of the year he coming in you could call the operations over there and say yknow is this airplane on the ground and you you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there now at port columbus you couldn do that but you could over there because you can walk around on the ramp over there at sunday uh nothing for a whi i don want to do anything until past january yknow because i ve i like said it since nineteen seventy four i ve never had thanksgiving christmas or new years off without having to work either a seven to three or a three to eleven yknow and it like i i figure i deserve this yknow it about time i get to not eat uh thanksgiving dinner at ten thirty in the morning so i can go to noo uh go to work at noon or something yknow or or open the christmas presents uh yknow at five clock in the afternoon because i work christmas day so yknow i think it my time yeah and yknow i i would like to have another job but i would i would love i know you ll say this is really stupid but i would love to have a monday through friday eight to five job never work another evening a saturday or a sunday if if it can be now i know i ll probably not be able to do that because wants me to come back there so as a contractor so i don know yknow you mean at oh yeah i would have to work shift work yeah so yeah um hum right yeah media hype yeah there is there like two people who are like from the uh th i mean they re not old but they re like from the forties and they have bought generators they ve bought water they ve got extra food they ve got a freeze extra freezers they bought ammunition it like hello yknow i just think it yknow the only thing i going to do is maybe two weeks before i might get a hundred dollars from the bank machine and uh i have three cars so i ll probably have one of them full of gas and other than that it like yknow to me if you are say bank one and i huntington and january the second people have all kinds of problems you and i are going to be the laughing stock of the corporate america and do you really think you and i want to do that so to me nobody gonna have a problem because they re gonna go remember bank one yknow you go get ten bucks and you get five hundred out the machine uh yknow it like who wants to do business with them nobody gonna do that yeah yknow maybe some little company um that really doesn yknow have a big impact but i don see where anything gonna happen at all yknow yeah i mean there are people who think cars won run and it like a car has a computer but it does not know if it is uh monday or two thousand and fifty it has no idea it it means nothing it not date sensitive yknow so she a librarian at an elementary school one block from our house um hum yeah it it is she doesn even drive to work yknow so uh she undecided right now um right um hum at yeah uh she really likes it well yeah she went to columbus alternative high school right um hum uh college without the tuition so hard i mean every summer they have homework that has to be done or else the first grading period is an and when uh my yeah oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there and once she got into it she went uh maybe not so i said well what yknow whatever so then she wanted to go to because it basically a columbus public school that geared to college only i mean if if you re not going to college don go there because you will flunk out it very hard and she got in the second year three weeks before school started and so we go over there and they hand her this stack of material that got to be done in three weeks so i thought well i ll just call and i called and i talked to the principal and i said yknow they gave us all this stuff and yknow everybody else has had june july august to get this done and she got three weeks and she goes and the principal goes that correct and i go well there no way she can get this done and i i said yknow everybody else has had all this time and she gonna get it done in three weeks and they go that right so they take there no excuses yknow and it it is very hard i know my youngest daughter who is just as smart as my oldest would do horrible there because yknow basically they say uh we re talking about china this week and uh on december the fifteenth we want a report on why chinese people do what they do yknow and it like and every week they don come by and go have you started have you started have you started do you have the outline right and it up to you to go gosh i have to have an outline i have to bibliography i have to have the facts i have to interview some people and if you don sit down with a little calendar and go this week i getting this done this week i getting this done and this you just fail so my oldest daughter is pretty uh detail oriented so after we kind of he helped her start yknow and say yknow you re you re gonna hafta do these things so you get this done and i said and basically get it done like two weeks before it done so then you can say oh this isn very good and yknow amend it or whatever or or help somebody yknow get somebody with typing whatever so she really good and it it helped her at school a lot because i know they uh she she toured here at ohio state and there were some people here that come from cahs and they go this will be easier than your highschool so hum um hum um hum yeah um hum yeah no because um all the kids take that cutoff calivorn california achievement test i don know if you re familiar with that and it like yknow because it say like you and i go to school you go to you go to dublin and i go to the worst school in columbus and we both make straight a well when you take the california achievement test that really the a mean nothing because it like let see what you understand and have learned the score on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those because yknow they always pick on columbus public schools they go oh it so look how bad their test scores well yknow if you take say like uh the worst school in town which i don know what it what it would be but lets just say it uh brown school well you have children there who have not seen dad in probably ten years and mom is basically sometimes there or in prison so they live with grandma how do you expect them to do well nobody there to yknow i not a uh yknow like an ogre or anything but yknow i always keep tabs on my kids yknow like i ve always gone to conferences even though they got straight a i go to conferences and teachers go well what do you come for and i go if i don come then it like saying i don really care so i always go so they know that i keeping tabs on things and i don demand a i just demand them to do their best and i said yknow if your best is a then that what it will be but i said if your best is an a and you re getting a you got me to talk to so uh back to the brown school uh there are kids like my daughter there who make straight a and when they take the um what is that thing the proficiency test zoom through it and get like outstanding on it and uh then you have uh thi this probably sounds really biased or bigoted but then you have the kid whose mom and dad aren together and and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes proficiency test he gets like a th thirty okay do you want to know where i was born alright i was born in boston uh lived there but bef i moved away before i really even remember it moved to detroit uh when i was there i spent about ten years there then moved to ohio uh with my family of course and then right now uh i uh at ashland university but i thinking about coming to that why i came down for the summer because i have friends down here so i taking a look at it so basically that basically geographically where i ve been uh yeah my parents live in akron uh like north of akron cuyahoga falls area but like i said i my uh i had apartment down there but like for the summer i down here so i a transient always moving my stuff uh hum it a real boring boring town i feel i feel like uh i have friends and when we say oh we re going out to the bar like we all know which bar because there is only one that college students go to and then so no no um there a few townie bars but college students aren real welcome there so yeah basically for the entire summer and then if i like it ah i ll be i ll be enrolling so no my roommates are i just my mom wanted me to but i uh the way it stems right now i just and rather work earn money yeah well actually i uh do silk screening for shirts for my like for um like on the side for myself like to generate income and then also afs as of monday uh i working at ohio it an environmental group i will ih be doing canvassing type stuff just basically going door to door sign this petition stuff like that yeah yeah it uh three hundred fifty a week for forty hours but i like the hours more than anything because it two to ten so i can sleep in and yeah exactly in the middle of the afternoon yeah that that gonna be a problem they said bring bring water you re gonna definitely like they have no dress code which is nice so i just gonna wear shorts some good walking shoes and in a shirt because it could get rough he could get real rough i bet um well actually i wanted to learn more about it i felt like like i really have no passion towards it but i thought this would be a good way to learn about it and maybe pick up like uh some ideals ideas about it so i figure it something i should know about so like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the mar some elementary school i believe or no i think it a high school in marion was built on um an old weapons depot and so like leukemia has rise and so like that uh their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and uh get that changed they have also done other things ah other uh they do anything dealing with the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so it for the entire state and so this is just the columbus there is columbus toledo dayton i don know any others no not at all there not much in ashland yeah exactly pass through it random jobs for yeah like when i do the silkscreening in this is kind of random but just anything that be great i would do it definitely i living over on iuka uh if you on the other side of high street you know the mcdonalds right by high street it like back there a block so it right near like lot of other student housing um hum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh ah it seems like there a lot more to do in columbus obviously but my mom teaches there so it free tuition i get a tuition waiver so and i figured i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i to i up to like ninety four right now and i figured that would be a decent i mean it translates over because we re on semesters it will get all messed up there but it it like i half way to three fourths done with uh with my degree so if i wanted to transfer now would be like because i after this point if i stay any longer a lot of the credits won transfer over it would be a waste of time because most places don like to take more than half so that why i just figure right now i should look yeah exactly exactly no it uh like i a business major and i hear the business school here is pretty good so uh i wanted to take a look at that and my roommate is a business major so he he was going to show me around the they have new buildings i guess so he said he would show me around there uh also i i really do like i came down for few games and things like that and i like the enthusiasm that people have for this place like ashland is so small there a select group that has enthusiasm but nothing like here i mean this is everyone is just enthusiastic about the university and there might be things they don like specifically about the university there uh i you don hear eh any like like universal negative things about this about the university ever yeah i hear yeah it ridiculous i mean plus its a nationally recognized school so a degree from ohio state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone at least gonna recognize because it big it big big name ashland it be more of a sell i be like okay we it small it private it accredited but still yeah it really expensive but that why i went there for now i wouldn go there it was actually my last choice uh for universities but i went there because the price it in in education it it top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education business school is coming up like they re building a new building but by the i ll be gone by the time it done if i decide to stay so it it ll be so as far as uh education like for small school and they just opened up their phd program in education and they re also known for political science but it a real conservative political science it a real conservative school and that doesn really match my my views on a lot of things um like they it dry they have uh real strict visitation policies things like that my thought is if you re if you re if you re considered an adult enough to move away then you shouldn have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember when i was a freshman in college it was we did crazy things but still oh yeah yeah very much so yeah it a you can if you re if you can go to a girls dorm until i think maybe the afternoon i think maybe eleven i not sure uh but you have to be out by a certain time uh it not as bad as like malone like i don know if you ve heard about malone they have like certain days so it not like that but it still just a pain you re allowed to have guests of the same sex like it eh ih like i don live in the dorms but assuming i did if i ah if i had a girl come from home to visit me i have to either sneak her in and like just hope we didn get caught or have her stay at a friends like uh at a girl friend of mine a lot a lot of people yeah yeah so it kinda and the university knows that going on so they just i not sure really what they do no this real like to live off campus you have to well after my class it ll be twenty two and senior credit status but my class was twenty one or senior or senior credit so i got to move off campus but like had i been a year younger i wouldn have been able to because they have to wait until twenty two so they re yeah you re not allowed no it very much so very much so because there two thousand undergraduates and basically eighteen hundred of them live on campus and then if you live off campus like i like to think i don have trouble making friends but like that but i ve had friends get arrested by the police because after ten thirty like the university there they re vehicles they so it just like it totally like you know unruined by tourists and it not it not like overrun like yknow like it gets like a lot of these yknow like like whole down in florida you get like all the almost it of like heard all the i ve major i ve okay cities are just reef like barrier okay the is studies yknow strip biological malls and all that like a it lot like lot do they do have they why like that okay any of those like yknow um hum jamaica caribbean the like too destination honeymoon a like it is that cool tha that that that the best places where you have to actually work to get there but sydney is like is is like pretty much accessible because okay so people can like fly in do do their do their little wedding thing fly out wow i can i can believe it of all iy i i yknow i thought i just that just blows my mind you can spend all thousands of dollars to have it just for a wedding that true i sure i sure i sure i ll show you yknow welcomes all those dollars but did they have like little like a like a like a wedding industry it like uh huh wow they wear those kimonos or they wear like a like a is it like a wed wear a what is it okay okay they said uh they they said it pretty much uh regular like just a have them western where they wedding where they throw the rice and okay i thought maybe you would like crash one of the the weddings say i a i a i a i a professor i doing studies here as a what did you spend most of your time doing besides snorkeling really take a lot of time did you teach at university level really you like the university level do they have like these big lecture halls over there too oh do they really i thought that was just something like maybe unique unique to the states wow that intimidating you walk in and i like you re like oh my gosh so it oh you know the fire on that huh i so they got baptism by fires is that like cause you you survived okay because you re here you re still teaching is that right um hum did you guys thing yknow it just yknow how to you have all these people and you gotta keep their attention for like an hour or two oh is that right which reminds me it like your da your your eighteen year old eighteen month old daughter yknow you got to yknow like amuse them yknow and and so like distract them really what did he tell you throw nerf balls in the audience and wow i don know i that like that that a that a yknow that i guess that one way to yknow to to get you into the into yknow into the business but i th i don know i don know how do you prepare yourself to teaching in front of a large audience that like something you have to like yknow i would have to anyways you get ease myself into oh i don know do it and incrementally like yknow like you re like like do like like hear a recitation then we ll then like kind of like work your way up you had done okay so it this was like totally okay yknow welcome to australia you know yknow here your here your here your text book yknow go to work so how many years did you actually were there teaching three years wow man and you re loving it too at least at least you re trying to convince yourself of it you re not da like you re warming up oh well is that right oh is that right oh san frans well did you spend much time or were you just passing through the airport in san francisco really what are they like it san fransis is is it kind of like like a like a like i think is it it is a pretty much a ritzy place okay okay uh okay it is that silicon valley okay just is it like a sno kind of snobbish or are they a damn what a problem then would you would you that you would don you wish you had those kind of problems huh oh my gosh you you you you be sleeping on the beach before you shell out that kind of bucks um hum man i heard housing is tight out there but that crazy you like like the people japan do like they re cheaper flying in than than than doing it at at home my gosh did you say that what traveling does it makes you appreciate what you got makes you realize all the things you do have and makes you feel like wow like actually pretty much know where that why i want that why i want a book exactly not too much now just studying yknow like yknow like you realize it it it teaching studying takes up a lot of time uh no that why i wanna do the hiking things i like ready i can get a like a visa because i somebody told me wow yknow you go some some places in europe you might have some problems getting a tourist visa because sometimes they work illegal did you really what you do oh okay oh okay so people will call up and they have no idea what they want it like why did you do this like why did you do this to me because they ll call and they ll be like yeah i thinking about a blanket or like what do you think about those and like it real funny when people ask me my opinion like on things like this like it funny when people uh call up who are close to our age too uh it it funny to hear just how how nineteen eighteen year old people are on the phone it really funny compared to it funny too when when you can tell kinda like what peo what people all backgrounds are and what what what kinda like their job is by their by their like how they conduct themselves on the phone and people you know

horrible and uh saying numbers like like and or kind of like an east coast accent she it was real funny and she was just asking me like what it looked like in our building you know so that always funny too you know you call people from the phone you don know what they look like you don know what the other person looks like and what the building is set up like it interesting sometimes people just go on and on about things like hi i got a a or like they have like some like insane problem like i don know why they re sharing it with me like you know like i had to get this you know i had to get this chair because my brother in law yeah he sat on it and broke it man i got in a fight with him about that yeah his wife and blah blah blah and going on and on about it and it like like yep like his wife is a bitch or something i don know i don know what things for me to or like i talked to this one guy he was he was a navy seal and he did like a couple tours in vietnam and he was he was talking about how he is he was drunk and he was he was from alabama he was like yeah i about half drunk now so i trying to figure out where this model number is and like i don know we to him for like fifteen it like like sometimes too i think about people you know they call a and especially when i talk to this sometimes people call in and i i ta you know i get the same people or whatever every once in a while especially if like there people have real specific weird names or something that i can remember i ll they ll call back and i ll think about them and it like how i ll have this you know it like we have this weird like five minute relationship something like that like every couple of weeks or something and it like what to think about what their life is like and what they are actually like in the you know it like it real weird it like i know yeah get everybody yeah harvey keitel that what i was actually thinking of um where he takes the pictures on the corner a of at the same time everyday yeah yeah and only for like a brief period yeah uh it it open twenty four hours so there people that you know it like shifts overlap you know it not like everybody leaves and there everybody comes in you know it like um like when we re there like the night shift people start to come in people that work from like eight to four eigh eight to four a and that be really weird i guess like nobody calls then or something like ten people call so she like it easy she like i get paid to she said that it like i don know some people who work there like i couldn imagine working complete nights you know i mean i like working two thirty to eleven i th i rather work like maybe like noon to eight that would be better because then it like i mean i more toned to staying up late anyway just because of like how it is or whatever but like i don want to have to get up really early either like i could never imagine having a nine to five job like that be horrible have to go to bed so early yeah it okay i don know like i think hi i think uh high school in general like they i people always talk about raising the standards you know for high high school things but um i think um it kind of like it it really hard to to like i ve thought about before just what wrong with like the education system in general like i don know i think it more of a more of like a it college is a little bit different i guess but it more of like this whole like the teacher the teacher talking and it like it like the information goes from like the profe like the teacher uh mouth to the student notes with like out go without going through either of their brains you know it like just from like real monotonous and like you know dates and blah blah blah about you know just like re it it a it real structured but it real hard to think about what then what i could what to do to change that it kind of like more like i don know i mean i had really good like there was a couple really good teachers like my history tea teachers and english teachers were really good um just because you know it was more like they seemed like they wanted to be there as opposed to i just doing this because i don know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it obvious that if they didn have the textbook they wouldn know how to do it you know like where if people didn have their notes like they wouldn be able to do it themselves you know it kind of like um and so i think i it it i it that when people have real enthusiasm and like you or and put a lot of effort into making it not the same everyday not just like a lecture and when then we do homework and turn it in like you know it like we do like like in history class we do like role role playing things and like plays like we like just things that are different and like my sociology and psychology teacher were real good he did he was the same guy who taught history he was real good too like it was really crazy obviously but like it just like interesting um like the sociology of high school and like having a sociology class about a just well well it sort of like the sociology of like cliques you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like like that that that a real strong uh like who am i going to vote for i have no idea it kind of like picking the the least of evils i mean i don really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for elizabeth dole and then she opened her mouth and things came out uh she had the best chance out of any uh any woman that ever run for president and she was in a major party which hasn happened before and it would have been really funny to see what happened to bob dole over it yknow be the first man after run for the office i don know i i kind of see al gore winning just because he the most like one of the mo he has the most experience in that general um i don know i don particularly like anyone really although i haven been paying a lot of attention to it just because i don know yeah and because i back when i was in high school in my a government class i was paying attention a lot yknow like i read the columbus dispatch everyday and i read news and world report for my economics class and i was totally caught up with everything and then i got here like i don wa i don care yknow yeah and i i got to argue about stuff there here i just kind of sitting around like trying to cram organic into my head and playing around with my linux yeah a lot more just different things yeah just keeping my a up enough and yeah i really really hate the fact of a government telling me what to do i really hate that um and like affirmative action stuff totally burns me up the idea is wonderful but it it just executed very poorly i mean i saw like during high school how easy it was for me to get in to places i mean the citadel was begging me to come yeah yeah they called me like a few times and just begging me to come i know how hard that is for uh white males to get into it and i saw like one of my friends had to work so hard to get into i and then there was another girl who i really didn think was that smart she kind of um inner blond and she got in yeah yeah it just i see it working and i don think that it is just executed properly so i would almost rather have it not at all than have it executed as it is now think in the case of a tie it should be used but yknow like if there a black woman who is very well qualified for a job and a white male is equally qualified for the job the black woman should get it but i like if test scores are identical and they have the exact same experience yknow objective ways they are identical then the black woman should get the job but there is no to me the most qualified should per person should get the job end of story and that it yknow it it best for society in general just employers need to be employers just need to do that on their own and it tough to be able to trust uh business like that but it a private business they need to be able to yknow they can do whatever they want um i do not like i just don um i think it it kind of like you get what you pay for anyway and um i not saying in general but with the experiences that i ve had um certain families where they don uh socioeconomically just not as well off it doesn matter how much money they re given for their education they ve they won take proper advantage of it because the they have their parents to look up to who didn take advantage of it yknow so if it kind of the mentality if my parents did okay without it then i don need it so the money just kind of wasted oh yeah yes yes hum no i haven okay no i haven been following it really it not that the property taxes are that much higher anyway it that um the homes are worth more because of the school system and the safety of the neighborhood and yeah there there are a few things really that go into it yeah it basically feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes exorbitantly high i mean they it is a little higher but yeah it it not ridiculously high yeah it is worth more what i can understand is some people live in upper arlington and they send their kids to private i don understand that yeah you spend the money to live there and then you go somewhere else i really don understand that some people do it yeah it was pretty much upper middle class um and like even the people the maybe their apartments didn look as impressive but they were making money and like uh one of my friends who had the apartment in arlington they had this little apartment she from india um her house in india is like this mansion and they have servants there i mean it really impressive just the houses are just worth more so you can get as much house here but yeah everybody is doing well what bad about where i work at it it not so much racism as whereas if you re my supervisor i just using as an example and i do something wrong they re going to come and ask you so no matter what you say it going be law it ain going come and get my story so that means if you re working with me and you screwed something up i the one that eventually going get in trouble yeah but yeah well no they don no i don see that kind of racism at all basically uh it just the talk and stuff it not uh like you know what i mean uh i black i better or i white i better it it none of that no because like uh i work like i said my supervisor is a black woman and i get along good with her the the other woman that an indian woman i get real along real good with her the other guy is a black guy i get along with him real good with her but my supervisor got a friend that a black woman that works in another department now she will come and talk to her and dump all her work onto us and then she the one that i ll be hearing you know you don know what they re like black ass and all this you know they re prejudice and all she doing is yelling about being pres their prejudice against her what she don understand that her damn job it ain my job i doing her work she ain but she yelling at everybody prejudice against her and i got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work yeah that what i saying it only a coup yeah it only a couple people it not majoree of people i work around black like i said a majority of people i work around i get along with great i could fire them because they re gay i could care less the two girls that used to live across the street from me were gay they re still real good friends of mine live down in circleville guy across the street is gay i worked in a gay bar one time i was the only straight person in there every girl that walked in there she come right to me no offe because i wasn gay but you know what i mean i could care less about gay people but like i said that was the way i was raised yeah my my way that i was raised if people burned you once that fine they burn you twice get rid of them you know it don matter what they are there was gays probably when i was in there like i said i could care less but i don really know about how they should handle that because that a weird situation but you know what i mean just because somebody is gay ain going to come after me they know i ain no but you know yknow that be like you know what the hell the the putting on some kind of gay raise to make you gay yeah there is do i uh well when they built the continent up on one sixty one it was almost all gay german village was almost all gay at one time uh yeah there there was a big gay you got what about twenty gay bars probably here in columbus alone you know that i know of because you can look in the lantern or some of these newspapers we read a lot of newspapers at work but uh there lot of gays but like i said they re just like regular people you know i not really am sure how to answer that i would say more conservative but i might be wrong because my answer wouldn be that good on that question no offense but you know what i mean it yeah because like i think columbus is more friendly than most places you know like when i was out in california it was like they spit on you i was working out there well back then i was working at a cycle shop but i was in the service but i was working there yeah well at tennessee they re even friendlier in some places yeah you hitting on me get the hell away well see that like my wife she said i would talk to the devil you know like i told her it the way i was raised when i retire i like to move like to mount sterling or something like that i would like to stay right around columbus i don like the way columbus is heading ah for a big city don get me wrong you can get anywhere real easy in this town but when i say i don like the way it heading they re cramming so many houses and everything and apartments and stuff it getting so congested it that what i don like yeah i had a boat and i got rid of it because i will not even go up there go to hoover yeah what really weird is where i live at i live right by right i don even have city water and sewer i the only one on my side of the street i the only little one on my whole block they re build two hundred thousand dollar houses around me these people drive by look at my little house there in the middle of it all with nobody around nothing but land hey i don know that the way i am well see that like a big thing you don understand when northland shopping center closed down and all the where where i at they got so many of them strip malls like you re talking about with stores of them you know and then easton you don hear much about that anymore yeah i ve seen that yes but there we go again you know that be better there used to be a place in upper arlington on zollinger road when i was a kid it used to be called the arc you heard of the group the byrds right they came and played there one time that was a teen club like i said you have nothing like that for kids nowadays and at whetstone park they used to have shelter house in the summer they held teen dances every weekend yeah and in the winter they build big out there where the casting ponds was let you skate they have big bonfires when you re done skating don have nothing like that nowadays somebody would fall through the ice and they sue them yeah but they don have it yknow there ain nothing else to do well back when i was a kid they had battles of the bands at the mall northland mall would host battle of the bands once a month veterans memorial would have it valleydale had uh of the bands and stuff like that you know places where kids could go well i just like because its smaller and i like the area it pretty flat down there and plus see southern ohio got a la lot of good places to fish so that mainly it probably more for fishing because i like johnstown better if you really want know but there isn many places to fish up there well is that good enough and i said yknow i don know why you are insecure i said everything you do you do well i said i i try things and just bomb at them and i said you just zip through them and i said you maybe some day when you re older you ll look back and go oh i see what dad was talking about but she just can see that um yeah right yeah yeah if if she passed a hundred people and ninety nine of them said oh that really pretty hair oh those are nice earrings oh that a nice shirt those are nice pants and one guy goes what with that uh lipstick she will remember that what with that lipstick for about a month and i like gosh yknow yknow and that sad yeah because i told her things like i said yknow what you really need to do is like in the morning when you re all done dressed you need to look the mirror and go i look pretty good today or when you ve done something like say uh she in a play right now and when you come home at night you need to look in the mirror and go i did pretty good at the play today other people did well but i think i did the best i ve done so far yknow and i uh and it not to make yourself an egomaniac it just to yknow that like those little subtle hints yeah that and i think i i a firm believer that uh little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than look in the mirror and going look at them hips and you go this one you go i getting a gut and yknow it like that so negative to yoursel would you tell your mom that yknow yeah hey everybody has it right um hum right yeah yeah i mean uh i ha i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i couldn do this couldn do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i always think of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so yknow because the yknow they just i don know how i got i sort of feel i mentally okay now but i don know how i got here because i ve been the other way it hurt me yknow and it well yknow yeah yeah okay that number thr mm i have a very general uh opposition to this kind of thing uh no matter where it is anymore uh my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing because i see the uh th total destruction of our center cities uh and i say when i speak of center cities i don necessarily mean just cities the size of columbus wus was wizh wus is the largest one in the state of ohio now but i talking places like washington courthouse which maybe have fifteen thousand or um uh wadsworth which maybe have eighteen thousand uh this kinds of thing is being developed on the peripheral of the cities is just totally destroying those and a consequence i feel it breaking our society down to the point where we don don know our neighbors at all anymore the uh it quite common anymore that if you go three houses down you have no idea who those folks are how they feel what they might do for you or you can do for them uh and that all applies to the polaris question as i see it and i think also that uh i it it a it a very very major financial uh gain for the developers who are doing that and it going to therefore harm uh the many many areas affected such as north north north north north what the name of the uh north what northland li yeah northland i can even say okay do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there so much heavy uh political and financial well i gonna reverse that statement uh there so much heavy financial influence upon the political uh influence that uh it it almost a forgone conclusion and if it doesn occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or next a next election but i think that in fact it will go i didn quite understa hayer hear you a little but not not nearly like she is no when you re fifty five or or is it sixty two whatever age there that age limitation and or you based upon age or disability or being out of town uh you re allowed so but routinely we ve do done the out uh i mean done the uh absentee over the years no going back to basic politicians i i i think we have uh i think the vast majority uh are truly good honest people they try to mean well i i concerned always that uh people who go into politics are in fine shape when they start but the tremendous influences are brought to bear that they never had had the opportunity to comprehend before they got there they re just overwhelmed it it and i don necessarily think it a it a a dishonesty it like a tidal wave they get caught up and they can resist the direction that being put or they are being pushed but right now with his attitude the way it is i say that me and my family are better off not having him stirring up a bunch of conflict or whatever so he saw he seen my oldest son when he was like two i was at my cousin wedding my cousin invited me to his wedding and me and my son went that was before me and my husband got married that another long story he was three when we got married and um my hu my dad threw fit yeah like a little kid and really he he didn say anything to me but he made my aunt feel like a little pile of dirt his sister and uh so he just really showed out that day but what so funny is our baby my dad has red hair and our baby has red hair so and he and he looks uh he looks more yknow like that side of the family and i was ju he he was born we couldn believe it we didn know there was redheads on my husband side of the family and then we found out that he had a great grandfather with red hair and blue eyes that my dad has red hair and blue eyes so it just very comical i was just like uh oh i said well god has a sense of word that what i said so don think the saga over um hum uh huh um hum um hum um hum um hum um hum um hum um hum um hum yeah um yeah right um and it sometimes that um the person up because a child they re so innocent and you can help but love them and i know my mom had a big problem with the whole inter racial thing at first but she my ki she loves my kids and she loves my husband now and it was just taking her out of her you know where she yknow you you grow up hearing those lies and yknow it just experiencing someone for who they are and so she uh she grown uh uh she yeah she expanded her horizons if you will and yeah no no they they divorced when i was like ten or something so i would say yes and no i ve uh i ve uh i feel pretty accepted and yknow just sometimes it just like they re like oh well she couldn understand or something like that but for the most part i there yknow no weirdness he had he had a few cousins yknow make some little comments but no nothing i mean his mom and his dad are cool and his brother and sister they re fine uh no no my dad the only weird well him and some of his brothers and sisters are kind of out there too but um hum um hum em oh yeah um hum um hum um hum um hum yeah um yeah um hum right that good yeah um hum um hum eh as much probably no the funniest thing though was with my husband and the because he so he so fair and he said in the hospital people were looking at him like there no way that could happen he said that because yknow they take them off to weigh him or whatever and i said you don leave him he said people were looking at him like who who yknow somebody lied to you buddy he said they were just looking at him like yknow no way they were like no but ah okay um hum um hum oh yeah um hum okay ok um hum um hum great um hum sure um i grew up in lima ohio and which is only about an hour and half from here north i came here in nineteen ninety one i believe here being columbus um i got married about three years ago and right now i in the process of doing a little bit of everything i ve worked all my life um until about the past two years and i ve just been working like part time and um doing crafts and things like that because i ve always been like in the financial analytical end and the other side of my brain wants some work so really that about it i have a dog he outside right now and that it for my kids yeah um really anything like right now i just painting and um they laugh at me because i went the other day and found some chairs that were that badly and asked if i could have them cleaned them up and i painting those and things like that so no no yeah i gave them to my sister and my mom and stuff like that so yeah it kind of fun um hum yeah no that be neat i love to do that yeah right yeah that would be fun i looking for a part time job as we speak i ve been like doing temporary on and off and the thing with that is you could work yknow for four five months and then nothing and then just like that so right now i looking for something permanent uh mostly accounting things like that uh such as accounts receivable for nursing homes and things like that pretty in depth um some of the day by yknow if i just go for a day it filing and what not getting phones but most of the jobs actually you learn a lot so boy it would have to be um something that i actually enjoy um what happened was ever since i came to columbus almost every company i work for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state and i wasn interested in that uh because my husband works for the state so obviously he not going anywhere um so i got tired of that and that why i kind of went to temping and stuff so it be one with a variety um i unfort i say unfortunately good at accounting and stuff but that doesn get to express my creative side as much so it would be um my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people as well and like would do presentations at seminars and stuff like that occasionally too so right just a teeny bit enough to satisfy me so that was good yeah i do um i prefer i ve done it by myself but i would pf prefer to do it with my husband and stuff europe i was there for almost a month did one of those tours where you get on the bus um and did the london and the france the and italy and to holland and germany and everything that was really neat right yeah yeah that very true we haven done that much yet uh because his family lives in albuquerque new mexico we re at a at least every other year we re out there which is great but it takes away that big trip um we ve been and then his brother got married in hawaii so we went out there so we ve just done the honeymoon at disney world the albuquerque a couple times and hawaii but we have plans to go to europe he he wants to go to england and things like that and i wanna we re looking into greece so yes uh actually kawai yeah so it was really nice i thought it course i didn go to all of them but it was nice yeah and it it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so yeah it was it not bothering me but when i talk and move my head it like hitting me and i just am not sure you can tell me if it not anywhere near my mouth so yeah it i keep it wasn but then it moved so well there we go yeah hilliard um hum i like it um i ve lived i ve only lived in the northern end i ve lived in dublin and old worthington and now hilliard which is kind of around the side um but i like it because it has it own little well especially worthington it own little city within a city and um i think they have a lot to do yknow the parks and things like that so um i ll just hold it but i like it because it has art and culture and um it doesn feel like a big city unless you get stuck in traffic so yeah yeah but i bu i have purposely tried to work close or do the back roads it nice from hilliard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or yknow where i ve been working on back roads so it not that bad um hum yes yeah right the snouffer and all that yep i used to live up there too so very much so yeah i think this year it gonna be even worse stocking up water right yeah um hum yes yes yes really i haven noticed that yet huh yeah yeah i think it probably too though that a lot of people haven aren used to it i mean they re not from ohio i ve found that in columbus a lot so they re kind of yknow more tentative or they re from the south or something like that so they and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i ve noticed that a lot of people rarely do you meet people born and raised in columbus so um hum um hum huh that good no not really actually so some i have and then i ve run into the people that just like anything they wanna get out of their hometown they don like it they complain but normally i find that those people aren taking advantage of the yknow free art shows and yknow i mean the things that are free i like oh have you done this no i didn even know about it and you ve lived here all your life and i ve only lived here number of years and so um well just even like the parks or um like the art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the the irish festival in dublin which can be free yeah on certain days and things like that um the concerts on the river or on the worthington green really anything like that and they used to have the laser light show downtown the they don have it anymore um yknow just even if you do one thing free a month it it doesn have to cost anything but you you can go do it with your family or whatever so yeah um hum yeah four five four five six seven eight nine ten eleven tweleve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen ew and i hate hearing myself on okay i might want to try to adjust this a little bit again if you say it goes under my trik putting it under here dont know if that would help yeah that was probably gonna stay okay now it not it was better before there that better that okay we ll just try okay so i can just talk normal and it won be too loud because i talk loud okay so when i start laughing real loud you can turn it down so no one breaks their ear drums yes thirty nine uh north end over by riverside hospital henderson olentangy yeah um currently unemployed um hum so yeah i looking for work um taking my time looking for work it the first chance that i ve had in probably twenty years to sit back and get what i want so i doing that i getting unemployment and taking my time i ve got several interviews so some exciting ones so um secretarial administrative assistant type work uh i kind of happy i not doing that anymore it really takes a certain kype type of person to work for in that hard to find in that area so i uh in insurance off and on working for independent insurance agents so i did that until i uh came to a company that i stayed with for seven years and then they relocated to dallas so yeah um i didn wanna go to dallas so there was a couple people that went but probably two out of five hundred and nobody wanted to mo so i stayed here oh probably my family my kids are here i have a grandchild now so yeah i like to stay close to all them she is four months almost five yeah so i a new grandma thanks i don feel like a grandma either so have to be careful what i do they still watch me i guess uh oh oh that fun and that a challenging age too thirteen months that fun yeah um no i got to babysit for like a week and then she has a best friend that watching her baby and a friend of hers that has other kids too so it real good for the baby um hum yeah it my daughter yeah um hum uh she actually at uh columbus state she gonna study to be a teacher so she doing that and uh um hum yeah yeah she nineteen yeah oh gosh a whole lot more people whole lot more places to live seems like everywhere i turn there construction and and yknow you go down one one road and then you wait a couple years if you don go in that area and it all changed looks all different so and that mainly like looking at bethel and three fifteen north things like that yeah think the population um in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area um i don i don know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i ve been home i ve been reading the paper a lot more and yknow i more aware of what going on and i really um gonna be some kind of activist for um i don know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman clubs and things like that i just i think that gonna be really bad for the kids and and everybody around um there one off of uh bethel or no it off of henderson cahoots and then there the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and i couldn even believe they re like right across the street from each other yknow and it funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so thinking it really affects it yeah try to go around and until they make a women uh club won be real uh um i sure that it has because it enables a lot more people to get housing and and things like that um and i and yknow growth is always good my husband in construction so i shouldn be against it or anything but um you kind of like to have things spread out and kind of yknow have some space so um i work downtown the last year i worked downtown and then i think about oh probably fifteen twenty years ago i worked downtown and um yknow as far as the focus you mean like nighttime things or just anything in general or yeah well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it smaller compared to most downtowns i mean you yknow it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and you re out i don think it that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable that would be nice so uh i live up north um around carl and uh morse road so i have a house oh no then you wouldn be too familiar with everything huh um hum northland mall yeah with all the controversy about that and polaris and um hum um i don know i it it northland is such a a good location for all the people around there and it certainly not yknow um um a hurting nei or yknow a neighborhood that people don need the shopping so i didn see the difference of having both there lazarus everywhere there sears everywhere why not have it both places i mean i wouldn particularly go up to polaris if they take northland but we re not planning on staying there anyway so i didn yeah we ll probably move within the year um hum um the well i ve had the house excuse me um for probably six seven years and we just need to move it kind of small it a smaller house and um my husband works in gahanna so we were gonna look for some houses up that way and maybe some land we ve been looking at some land up north too um hum yeah it either gonna be find a house we want or we ll go build it oh a place on some land with woods and uh yeah water things like that right yeah we could put a little trailer there we be outside most the time anyway so um hum yeah yeah i would say anything outside like doing that um hum yeah we like to garden and that was one of the things too we want some space to to make a bigger garden and uh no uh no we kind of help my neighbor out he got a big garden next so we help him and he retired oh good because i don think i know that one whatever looks pretty when it comes if they hold yknow enough of my views i not gonna vote for a woman just because they re a woman and i not gonna vote for a democrat just because they re a democrat they better have uh yknow at least and i and i don need a hundred percent uh so that a agreement with my views but i like they be at in the ninety to ninety five percent range um but yeah uh i ll uh i don tend to vote straight party line either as i said i ve i ve moderated from when i was uh in college to today part of the the aging process and also partly because i ve i ve noticed that to get things done you hafta have a center and it the center that tends to rule when i was in college um we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in dayton came out with one that said america love it or leave it uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it america love it and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you don let them yknow have bad manners at the table and you don let them run around with the wrong yknow kids and you want them to behave well yknow that how i see america now and and america become more centrist uh and when it deviates from that either way that when people become upset um so i just think it important and i i remember when um who was the other president that i voted for that won carter uh black leaders would meet with him once a week and then they come out and hold this press conference and complain about he didn do this for blacks and he didn do th enough for blacks he didn do this and he didn do that and i used to say so to some my black friends don you see what you re doing don you see that greater implications of this oh no we need to have him move faster i said yknow that be great in an ideal world this isn an ideal world you hafta take it a step at a time whether you like it or not i said what you re gonna do is you re gonna make it look like he is so bad in all the issues you re gonna give people a reason to vote against him then if any big issue comes up that just gonna be added to everything else i said what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and praise him and that he doing a good job and that we re moving along steadily uh and i yknow i don think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means um i made that mistake when i was president the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy passed so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all the leaking walls yknow uh ceilings all of the peeling floors all the the bad chalk boards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said we re not gonna support those and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite track we went in and we said yknow um the eighteen months later when the board put anoder um bal uh levy on the the ballot we said these are great schools we have great teachers look at this kid he learning to read he made six months improvement in three months and all that kind ima it was image and it we were saying the same thing yknow we want to continue this we want to make even this better um we learned to say the negatives in a positive way and that important yknow and and you need to get that that you need to appeal to the center american don like extreme liberals they don like extreme conservatives yknow th they want they want peace um hum right i think it the right position to take um but it it like abortion that one of the the big i issues that divide people very quickly uh i think it moderating somewhat uh as the gay activists continue their campaigns um but that one where a candidate has to tread very carefully um i was proud that coleman said it and didn and didn back down on that um they told me a little bit about his character um i don know that i can answer your question straight forward because i believe in gay ri i believe in anybody rights i don know what happens between consenting adults in a bedroom is their business not mine um hum not if he been as open about it a as he was here um yknow clinton did that also and and thought he be able to um segre or not segregate desegregate the uh the the military and found out with his first action as president that there there a strong backlash against that at least nation wide and and and in the military but i thought it was the right stance um because it more open um and you couch it in terms of civil rights um my boyfriend thinks it wrong morally but doesn think we ought to be discriminating against uh he he thinks it a sin therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through yknow talking to them religion wise um i don think it a sin i think that um your sexuality is genetic based and that i you can no more change your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put a different um whatever those eye pieces are contacts i don wear glasses so i can never remember those terms um but that just cosmetic and anyone who tries to change their sexual orientation that cosmetic too uh and again my belief is whatever happens between consenting adults is their business not mine um so i don know that anyone could change it what was your question again why people because of the gay activism um hum yeah i was gonna say most them are i think so because i i when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on and then you start seeing a couple of black people on and then there was the jeffersons and although i found that jeffersons offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and made fun of of of black people in many ways in retrospect it was trend setting and what it did in in even in putting blacks in um advertisements on young kids saw them uh a and saw those ads and saw those programs and so it became uh a part of everyday life a and the more you see something the more it be becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now we ll look back on those programs and think they were trend setting instead of stereotypical um but it i sure it does have uh some influence because i think it did i it wasn the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepherd helped also not in my lifetime he hafta probably be a closet gay i listened to someone i just touched someone who will be successful you will be successful individual and that what most critical you yourself has to do it not the business because from you businesses observe oh yeah there gonna be unconditional love out there um hum um hum ma my my thing is is you still you you try do your best on earth through the attributes you have whether it supposed to be a missionary fine if you see a missionary working in the office there needs for missionary work in the offices around this on a campus everyday they re talking about diversity here all ya do is just sit down you know what it numbers game it not a numbers game at all just learn about one another and your gonna find out you know what i think they said the bli the color blind society um hum that all we gotta do when you re in a coma or when let say your out you can see anything you didn do the surgery on you are you gonna be sp you gonna qualify well i want this surgeon to be this and that and that then that do you want this donor to be this this and that tha some people will sa some people some people say that i feel sorry for those people i pray for those people because prayers the most powerful thing you can have it gonna get you through nothing else i don care what cha challenge you have in front of you you put in his hands and you have enough faith to practice it he ll come through it may not come through the way you think it you want it to but somewhere along the line you re gonna say uh for some reason i wasn su i supposed to do this i can explain it but you re always looking for reasons you re asking me i looking for reasons the but a lot of times you can give a reason it just happens why did you marry your husband why did you how did you meet your husband how did you come about how passing on to explain that to your offspring someday well aa of the thing is there things you can explain can you can explain that and those have been questions that i ve been asked by my our children we how you mom and dad oh gee i how do you well hey that a ri tha that one of the risks in life marriage but the thing is do you wanna make it work and you said don we divorce more acceptable divorce should never be acceptable i disagree with society there it should be something to work with it just like hey well what ty of sea you gonna have this year brien oh we re gonna have a losing season uh i don care now that that go over well here wouldn it it go over well oh we don care how we re gonna do we we just want five guys out there on the court and so forth but we don nah we re not gonna nah you gonna oh we lost were we lost one two academics this year i don know why but we got four guys and that okay that divorce that her attitude no commitment do these guys have commitment and you see the guys out there they wanna may go further possibly in their careers and professionals others want to maybe fill something whatever it is you ask each ind individual what is it drives you and that the thing you i get so perturbed in interviewers they ask somebody and and somebody comes back and say you know what i mean yeah what did he no i don get inside the guys mind and i don want what did he mean you know what i mean yeah no i don know what you mean ya know play dumb it pull it out of them what do you mean uh michael red what do you plan on doing after school when i was growing up they used to give the grade point average in the major of this of the of the student of the student atlef they don do it today unless the person a scholar i mean a you have tree point eight rhodes scholar hey okay five starters what you major uh huh needle pointing finger paints journalism and um medicine okay crosswords okay at gives our uh younger people some mentors look after doesn it and where re your scores and those oh i oh gee i just barely getting by passwords yknow but that the problem we ve lack of standards no that their right keep it private but no i wish those guys would just stop hey i i majoring in accounting i majoring in finance i majoring in business and i got three point five i got two point six oh and whatever the criteria is to play on the the team why aren you playing this week well i pracsting i still required to practice even though i can play this week why can you play it the it the rule what rule well if i don make certain things during the week which is academic i still hafta perform uh sports wise make that commitment but if i don fall if i fall through on that then i off the team period but those are things that be brought up publicized more instead of saying well hey we brought this much ticket gate this month and he got this scores and this percentages and that we need to expand more on that so that the younger people have some better role model to look at and not just playing round ball or the the spiral we need to get them out there and say how you gonna perform in school ya know i sure michael red got some mentors out there they see guys wearing number five and whatever the number is and eight whatever it was okay they got there a reason for it but what what what the other part of it we don do that because why we don wanna bring it up and we don wanna bring some embarrassment possibly or but that part of life when they get out in the real world i talking about these guys some would be successful in terms of whomever and some will be successful in other people eyes but the thing is show the kids that are watching them there is more than just sports sports is a by product here go to ohio state it is it is unifying and i just wish they but i guess there a rule out there i ve asked uh a news why they can promote the uh these uh you know they they show the roster here here their grade point average engineering major fine tell them what the majors are tell what these kids are what they plan on doing they re not all gonna make it to the pr professionals then what to do do they afterwards they get token jobs because their connections and then how satisfying is that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that where we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews with these people so that we can learn from them they put me on spotlight but we somehow we just don wanna uh i guess flood them with the we don wanna get the negative answer because of all might hurt the image of the university oh gee ya know when we who was it katsenmoyer well hey we realize that the university only wants players who ll draw gate money that all they wanna do they re not here for academics they don talk about academics when they re coming to ohio state i wish they would these guys going to military school and so forth you know they ve had problems before somewhere aline whether it academics or social are you ready take on this additional responsibility no but we don promote it again you bet we get sev persev every rule we have academics for the university oh you gonna be a sport athlete oh then you we got different standard here i sure they do they have different standards for as student athlete as opposed to what your standards were coming into college i presuming you were not an athlete i liked looking at the stories from a different perspective as a kid as a kid i was i was always like oh boy like action oh fight the bad guys yeah and now it uh yknow like looking sort of postulating deeper meaning to what the characters have to go through using elements of the story as a metaphor for things in real life uh and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child and our culture i think it kinda interesting and now that it coming back out uh i mean i look at things from a little different perspective but i mean yeah of the maybe i think i ve done about ten twelve paintings of which i like consider to be done and and like uh i say eight of them are wars related kinda thing so the recent ones have been the actually but i like star wars i didn like it but i liked elements of it and it unlike the the first star wars movie this one really is meant to be part of a trilogy the first star wars movie when it came out i mean it was uh uh in some many ways an experiment it was part of a of a larger story because the larger story was too large to film in one one movie but this one as a as a as a part of a whole i i reserving complete judgment until until see what else happens i mean from what i know this story was kinda happy and it was it many ways a children story but what has to happen within the larger story between now and and yknow the end of episode three is like the republic falls and the empire takes over and all the jedi are killed by this cute little eight year old kid yeah right um hum yeah i always maintained that uh back in the day uh the darth vader was the tragic hero of the star wars thing it wasn yknow about like the innocence of luke skywalker and rebellion and casting off authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a bad choice uh yknow gaining power because of it and then ultimately seeing the the folly of the ways and dying in the classic um tragic hero sort of way um and so i looking forward to how they build up to that point um lot of people when i was in high school they re what the hell are you talking about bo but uh um yeah i looking forward to seeing how things come about ah i like star trek um not so much old star trek uh i like deep space nine of the new ones um i mean back when it was new i liked the next generation but once deep space nine came out and it had a grittier darker story that wasn so cookie cutter in fashion there was ki uh a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode and more character development it wasn like these perfect people on this ship going and facing bad peo the the characters themselves had flaws and that caused for better drama so i like that don like voyager so much i i see that it when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it as something that would be even grittier eve they had the the potential for for excellent intercharacter conflict but they glossed over all those immediately within the first season um and that really bothered me and then it ultimately the story like they re trapped but they don really pursue like the issues of being separated from home in two factions that had very big differences stuck together on a small ship they just glossed over those and it became just like the next generation except for they didn talk to the federation as much anymore so i didn like that one so much but yeah yeah her her little boyfriend who was the the captain kirk commander riker per like stud persona i see in many ways i i mean i agree in deep space ah um big deep space nine fan it like i don dislike voyager i just don like it to the same degree um in deep space nine they had major kira who was a soldier and a revolutionary and i thought in many ways she like completely broke out of traditional gender roles i also like deep space nine in that uh they address the issue of different people living and working togeth different people of different i mean these were aliens rather than different eth ethnic denominations of humans but it it approached that from a less um from uh a more realistic standpoint in instead of having it yknow like an old star trek yknow everyone gets along then we come to people who don get along and we look at the problems it was centered on that uh i i getting off topic i wanted to go back to to voyager what you were saying about the the the uh generals i i liked at first having uh captain janeway being a female in the leadership standpoint but i feel i still think that uh the the women on the show particularly seven of nine um there are used as sex objects uh for the for the viewers yknow she doesn have to be wearing that tight outfit i think that for ratings i really do think it for ratings um she wears high heels why would she wear high it story elements her forceful personality too is yeah i mean i don see any particular reason for her to wear the spandex i except for to appeal to a uh eighteen through twenty five male audience which i think it does let watch seven of nine with the the children yeah yeah my favorite character on that show had always been chacote and i don like how i don like how his character has been portrayed in in the recis couple of seasons um i liked the fact that he was someone who had been a star fleet officer but because of a matter of principle uh left star fleet joined the makee but was still uh fundamentally an honorable person um and had to deal with being welcomed back into the fold of star fleet by being uh first officer on the ship but still had to balance his his new life uh i saw so much potential for uh interesting stuff with that but i feel that he become just the just another character to deliver lines for most of the episodes that i ve seen from the this this past season i stopped listen to music read the paper and have the tv on if there something i think i might wanna i might be interested in so i just do all those things and do my machine uh just at home i just have a tape that i use it kathy smith one of her things that i really like yeah um hum where do you do the aerobics yeah really i think that step would be really fun i ve never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me really wow yi yeah i know well i believe me i know yeah right right my frie yeah because my friend has some place where she even teaches yoga and has she real involved in it that she goes to um the one that i told you who the realtor but i should find out that studio if i find out i ll let you know because i know she she goes to some place called crapala in pennsylvania from time to time and who knows i just i don really do it for the meditation or anything i just do it for the stretching it almost like when i laying there and sh she and kathy saying yknow take even though i sound speedy i really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem yknow and so for me that like okay come on i don really want i don want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff i just wanna get going and do the rest of this so the part of it no its takes about fifty minutes but to do all the stretching because see well i ve had five babies yknow i really have to work when you talked about that the older you get i have to work really hard to stay in halfway decent shape so but i love it a yeah i think it does but it i like to exercise i think it fun i would just do it four hours a day if i could do that although i haven for the last six weeks i haven done anything because it just i ve had these other things that are really that are really pressing you know how that is you get you have some things you just have to get done and then when i get this stuff cleared out there ll be a break and then i ll be able to go back to it um hum oh wow that must be um hum oh right right yeah now who does he work for oh well i was because i was gonna say when you were talking about traveling you ll be able to get him to have a job where he can do lots of traveling i know um like my husband goes to europe and goes yknow he goes to california every month and and yknow he goes as little as possible but the point is if i if we wanted to be traveling he could be going a lot more a lot longer now he just goes for yknow a couple days at a time just to get back here because i don like him to have to ge go well and he doesn wanna be away from us but your husband you ll be in a position you can he can latch on to something where you ll be able to have lots of opportunities to travel you will um hum um hum yeah right right it is it right well i know with myself when we had pete always says that it wasn for me he would have gotten just too immersed in his job because he is really involved yknow he likes what he doing he has tremendous responsibility and but he loves it but the thing is when the kidth were little too yknow i was always having to pull him back and say don forget yknow they re gonna grow up fast if you if you don spend this time and now i mean like i said the youngest is thirteen and so he been at this for all these years and i don have to do that anymore i mean someplace along the way about ten years ago he got so involved in their lives but when they re little it a real different thing i mean you can understand why it be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours yknow you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on but he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i wouldn have to deal with it the whole time and work later then which was fine by me or he call and he say is it okay if i work a little late toni would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that wouldn even think about asking um hum yeah yeah yeah sure right right oh and i ve and i sure it will especially when you already recognize that yknow i if if you already know in advance what kinds of things you re gonna be uh helping along it a lot easier than trying to figure out what going on here yknow uh huh yeah right uh i that certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain doesn work in ways that people do so i think so i think a lot of it too has to to do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing yknow i mean i ve gotten so much better over the years i was very i ve always been real lot more temperamental we always joke yknow that that predictable and some of those things are not um even tempered are not things you would use to describe me but but not in a negative negative way yknow i just think that as i ve gotten older too i ve been able to see things and not be so get so concerned about things that that really weren that important anymore so i don know just lucky i know i was thinking that before when you were telling me stuff yeah right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i do don i yknow i think too i apologize to my oldest daughter every day about the poor thing all i put her through when we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i wasn a child but it like you don have realistic expectations of what what children are capable of or what they can do because if they re really verbal and my kids always have been really verbal because i ve talked to them from the moment they were born even whe yknow when they couldn talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole obviously see i don shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it seemed like they we had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well yknow you make sure you give it food and water and when it died it never i was so surprised that she hadn given him been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you don yeah they don get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could to wait to buy something else well within three or four months it was gone yknow and so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress on the floor in her room because but i mean now that was bizarre now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things or i i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and secondly we we had uh counter battery fire we called it which when they were shooting back at us once in north africa was kind of scary uh we were in position where we could fire on a a uh tank battle that was going on we had a foral forward observer up there where he could look down and see the whole thing and so he was adjusting fire and i don know how many tanks they claimed that we hit but course with ours if you hit you didn have to hit them direct you could hit them right beside them and flip them over and they were out of it so uh anyway we had a fine field day that one day uh firing at them the next morning about ten clock we heard one co uh heard a shell coming in and it was an air burst back of us about five hundred yards and then in a little bit there another one other side of us he was adjusting on us and we couldn do we didn catch onto where it was right away but by the time we started looking for our holes which weren deep enough we realized that he was in a clump of of cactus over on an adjoining hill oh about half a mile away i guess and he was getting even for the day before but uh the first lieutenant who was our um in command of the battery at that time said let get the hell out of here so there was a a wadi they call them it like a little deep wash that ran down oh a hundred two hundred yards from the gun position so we took off down there and they proceeded to set i think they set two of our guns on the battery i mean the tires on fire and they set the ammunition on fire they just shot our gun position up pretty good and uh and that night finally they well i don know exactly how we we got a hold of back to our headquarters but anyway we did and so they sent the prime movers which the the trucks which we moved the guns with out and uh we hitched what was rem remaining of the guns on them and went back wondering now they gonna put us in the infantry or something we don have any artillery guns but uh i don know it wasn but a couple or three days they had more guns i mean more artillery pieces up there for us to use and then one other time after in italy or when we were in italy we mo they moved us into a position that we should have never been in we were well let see we come alo uh around a mountain like there a mountain here and there not a real high mountain but a mountain and in the front of it there was a little kind of a dip and then on out and the enemy was over there well they put us in the front of that mountain right down i don think that there any question they could look right down our throats because and anyway we fired a a couple times from there and they started firing back at us and man scared me i had my my head was that far below the surface in a hole and i was still uh shaken but uh and i don remember i think they put one of our guns out of commission that time but they didn do as much damage as they might have those were the two worst things when we were in north africa there was one german gun that was firing on us and and they couldn figure where he was and finally uh i don know whether there were we had uh a piper cub observation plane i don know whether he saw him or who but anyway they finally figured that he was in a a rai a tunnel for the railroad and he pull out fire a couple rounds pull right back in so uh that night our captain who who one of these go go guys took one of our guns from a gun crew they went up to where they could line line aim on that opening of that tunnel and fired a couple of our shells into the tunnel and then took off so i don know whether th they did any damage or not but if there were any germans in there i ll bet they scared no no we we the uh the only germans i ever saw were pri pri uh huh well we we went in at naples which is pretty well to the south end of italy and we went up through the mountains we didn see a any well went up to uh let see now well we went uh about half way up to between naples and rome and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines and uh then they powers that be yknow american army decided well we ll go up to this little area of uh oh i was there six months or four months anzio you ve heard of the anzio beachhead we ll go up there and get around behind them and uh so they went up there but the germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot and that area of anzio was just flat as this table almost for an area back from the mediterranean back probably ten miles there ten or twelve miles long the coast long and uh so we the we had enough area to madip manipulate in and it was crisscrossed with deep uh uh ditches of some kind i don know whether they were irrigation ditches or what which we used as fortification but uh but even so the uh we were on this and the germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could again look right down at us so we didn go out in the daylight hardly at all and then uh after so long a time after i don know how long they again the powers that be said well we ll fool them we ll fog up that whole area with smoke and as long as the wind wasn too high well they could do it mean you they fogged it up to where you could hardly see your hand out here that way well at least we could move around a little bit but uh we sat there then for oh and it was kind of funny we were go uh there another guy and i and the the lieutenant who was a a forward observer were going out to a forward observe observation post and they uh observation lieutenant whatever his position title was was guiding he was in one jeep ahead of us and we were following him and of course we just had these little red blackout lights they called them we were following his jeep we kept going and we kept going and this other i and i were sitting in the back and i said hey suppose they know the german but uh anyway they finally got out we finally out out to where there was a bunch of ruined farm hou or fa ruined farm house and farm buildings and so on and uh they said well this is it so uh there and there were some i infantry men around there and so uh we started looking around for a place to land i mean got our bed rolls out so on and the next morning i don know i guess i was looking for a somebody who had a fire there warm up some some uh rice and something anyway one of the first guys i saw was a guy that had worked with my wife in the office there no i mean it nothing where they think they god and yeah one of uh friends cousins went that fraternity um don remember what the cause was of his um but i mean like said i mean that definitely it a dangerous drug to be using and i mean not to that they should it or i mean obviously that pretty extreme to do like i i mean it something to where should know the risks of it and know what goes it i mean it sorta like if you saw laying on the street and you decided eat it or whatever i you don know behind it or what going into it why would you do something like um if you re going to do something like you better at least the involved it and exactly you re doing before you do like that not at all oh yeah i don think anyone really affected anyone to much as far as that goes yeah i don know like i i mean it something i see it almost as being the thing as like cigarettes or whatever i mean yeah it bad for you there a lot of in it things like far as what it the effects it does to you it no worse than alcohol can do you um so i i don know i mean i not sure if they actually go so far as to legalize it but i don think it that they need to really spend that much time to control drug coming in i mean i i think it like or somewhere like where they ve legalized and they basically do it government where government actually gives them out and the government gets the money for it um i can almost see that as almost a good idea i mean obviously like i said are gonna do it no matter what i mean the same thing if want it they ll get their hands on it doesn matter what they have to do it they they ll come by i mean actually i mean i could see that they at least the money from and put it better of some sorts if they did the same kinda not really no yeah it would a little bit but at the same i mean it was a long time ago i mean i don know how mu how far in the you have to for things be considered a problem of something coming up again um i mean as long as he not didn have any of being like an addicted like i mean i i can it really bothers me much yeah um it would i probably base decision pol political um i can i really hold that him or obviously it not i be like oh good well let vote for him since did that but at the time i don i really hold it against him i mean it something that happens things like like by no means am i yay go president clinton or anything like but i mean i can i hold it him for doing something like i mean it that threatened the or whatever i mean it something he to deal with has to deal with the problems with him it up to him to resolve it i mean i along the like physical abuses things like that would probably the um like if got there were alleg uh excuse me he was allegedly beating his wife or like that then yeah that would cause a problem with i i can say that i would vote for anyone like i just like small like it doesn the or and i mean it that i can really see a problem it um but like i i mean he going like picking fights things like i i can say i support anyone like um i can say that really bother me like i said i mean it something that his choice his opinion what not i mean it up to him it doesn affect the like i mean he still long he making the right decisions or whatever yeah i mean i can say that they be any difference with them they did like cover things like that like religion and classes things like um i mean they didn really do too extensive on it they as far as religion classes go they basically told what the church believed about it how they felt about it but i they didn support it or like i mean they did realize that it up to the person i mean the most part yeah i mean like they they out and said the was it but at the same like with the research things like that they re saying that it could be a mental disorder of some i they couldn can much really condemn it to the point anymore that used um a few that they did ex specifically um homosexuality but i mean there were other that they cover i mean it not like it was an all out on being gay or anything like i really did not no college wise i don anyone of college age that gay i do know a few that are um but they in their thirties or so they people i met through friends um one of my friend parents had a friend that was um and just be over there whatever i mean i can say i see big difference between gay people or straight people so um hum yeah i would it doesn really either way honestly i of the matter is they so deal it i get over it i mean um hum well is there any kind of yknow training i mean do you are they doing like the whole job training after the two years or during the two years right right right i think that great yknow i think obviously there always a down side and but i think that too many people abuse the system and yknow unfortunately it very hard when yknow then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but yknow as long as they have yknow created a system whereby yknow it won be obviously as good for those people as it has been the ones who are genuinely unemployable but yknow i think depending on how um sort of focused they are on the individuals in their area or whatever however it divided up i don know hopefully not special treatment but obviously you would try to steer them more in whichever direction they re most suited for yknow as fall far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean yknow there is so much volunteering to be done everywhere and even if you don have yknow if you re lacking in whatever way you think that you can yknow there is something yknow hopefully that i don know um hum um hum actually they re they are working on it i sorry i didn mean to interrupt you uh um they ve they ve um just instated some bonus schemes where as the poverty lete level i think is considered um thirteen thousand pounds a year um and if if you re below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like extra bonus beyond yeah so there a bonus for back to work you mentioned earlier about like how this would effect the children with this two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system there for for reason than i do about the system here which is kind of unfortunate but um there i mean i don really think and a lot of situations of course i i sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who who really need it and who really yknow taking care of their children but unfortunately you don really see that side very much you see the people who like their kids see none of that money yknow they re left at home by themselves if if they can even yknow get them to school if they even go to school if they re even bothered yknow and yknow those yknow a lot of there there doc documentaries on all the time there so you really it sort of it more in your face than it is here at that i ever noticed um but i do think and and with that they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that yknow if a if a kid has bad behavior or yknow bad attendance that you send them home i mean i think that the most ridiculous thing like surely that not a punishment for a lot of these kids and yknow at least in england on these things i ve seen yknow they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shoplifting bullying yknow hotwiring cars at the age of yknow ten or something and i don know i think i do have sort of very strong about people yeah who are having all these kids and don take care of them at all um yes i haven they talked about that here actually have they talked about right right with the human rights right um personally i think it a good idea i mean uh i i mean to me yknow it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support yknow and that but i come from a completely different yknow background and everything else and the education and a lot yknow then most of probably the people that this would um concern but i do think i i don know i mean with uh the birth control that is available and yknow all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for yknow these people who just have so many children that they can feed they can take care of i mean it not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a can yknow protect herself if yknow the the man isn willing to do it or whatever so and and and adoption and all the other things um i mean i feel i lean toward no i don have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human rights side was that if they re yknow on cocaine or whatever they can make the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children right right right um hum right um well as far as the racism issue first uh they showed some figures on the news and actually it was like more whether they re play a video game where they re shooting people i can say they see that as being something that affects them once they turn into adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i don think that has anything to do with it no i mean like said i think little kids are really gonna be little kids if that stuff wasn on tv they re still gonna act the same way they re still gonna be walk around with toy guns things like that playing war or whatever um i think it probably some of both i think it probably more but i mean they are gonna have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can see that as being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that then there are women but at the same time i wouldn say there anything too over powerful as far the the number of guys being out there are violent i mean it something that unfortunately does happen but i mean it more how you re brought up whether you can control it or not all right to diversity and would would be would be interested in i mean i mean not just for the kids sake but but would be interested on their own behalf in in teaching the child what uh what his background really was right yeah exactly exactly but i do there and there the other side um they with with native americans too it yknow yknow our children are being away from us well not exactly you re giving up your children and and something has to be done but but there also there also that uh i i mean i think that it is probably a legitimate fear that children children of that group are gonna yknow gonna be homogenized out of out of their heritage but i don know uh yknow they re without parents yeah yeah if you cared that much about about keeping your keeping your own well there the kids ready to be um hum is that that what i would i would think in that i moon i mean because the dominant culture it i mean is always gonna be accessible to them yeah yeah yeah yeah and every to yeah yeah and and to a certain extent everybody gets the same upbringing be because through thr mass media and and and well malls yeah um hum oh yeah is yeah yeah well i wha what what neighborhood do you live in i yknow i see asians and indians and all kin everywhere but boy they don live on my street yeah yeah right yeah yeah yeah um hum yeah yeah yeah yeah um ye people that live there i mean we ve got the the yknow the indian department stores right down there on high street and and a couple of asian groceries but i yknow i i i don know where they live i mean it seems li it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i don i don know well i don know the people that i see around um yknow they re grownups really yeah um yeah yeah yeah um you re maybe you yeah you may be right could be could be i never thought of that an option i think so i think so um it it so sad to see a girl yknow have so many options closed off now i don mean it by any stretch that it a tragedy to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decisions she doesn intend to make uh and uh decisions are happening to her without her making them and um i think she needs to have as many facts as she can get her hands on yeah and i think um of course we would all hope that abortion wouldn be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think uh yknow i me i mean yeah there shouldn be there shouldn shouldn shouldn spend six weeks on abortion six weeks on what to do if you re pregnant um but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing in health class maybe and then and then there ought to it ought to be it sh it should be known that you can go to your counselor and get some information yeah yeah yeah yeah i i opposed to parental but i don have so that that opinion doesn mean as much as it from someone who did well yeah in a case like that th the parents should because there something going that shouldn be on the other hand i hate to see a thirteen year old have a baby because she was afraid yeah yeah well yeah yeah i mean it happened a lot and um i ve had two abortions one illegal and one legal and oh no never have years ago there was a citiz i don know if you were what your background is where you we ih were here but or not but citizen journal was a daily paper and it was it was the opposite of the dispatch was much more liberal they used this and it it was a morning paper and the dispatch is an afternoon paper evening paper and uh they shared the same facilities the same printing presses and everything and then dispatch when their lease expired wouldn renew their lease uh and at least it gave you a lot different view uh but the dispatch the only reason i get the dispatch is i do wanna know what going on locally you right you you you can really ignore i ve heard people say i refuse to read the dispatch well you got to know what going on locally i sorry but uh the day your trash is picking up what movies are playing uh but i don really rely on heavily for news even they don get facts right a lot of time uh oh not very right on and i would twenty the twenty years the first twenty years i worked at the bureau i was worked in statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them how easily they re misinterpreted and my wife does it it has been a director of institutional research at the university um data research uh uh they don really have other kinds of research there um and she says it amazing you can give these pep give people numbers and they immediately use them wrong they just don know how to use them uh they completely misinterpret even though it very clearly stated what they re doing and uh the newspapers do that a lot too people want a number they don wanna know the methodology that goes into it or the the disclaimers or footnotes they don wanna read the footnotes they want a number uh when i worked for the state one program we worked on was uh occupational employment statistics which was collecting uh numbers employees by different occupations in different industries in different areas of ohio uh which actually used originally started here the university in ohio it was a federal program department labor it was administered state level and uh it didn didn turn out very well so they switched it over to me uh for a variety of reasons which is not entirely the university fault um they had to rely on confidential information which we couldn give them because it was confidential uh by federal law it was confidential we couldn give it to them but they needed it so it ju it was just not a good one good way to do business uh and we would present information ok there for ins there this this number of people in an occupation but there was also a range of error on there where people wouldn notice that and they would take that number as gospel and you just could not convince them that well it really means more than that uh the big one would be uh wage levels and we didn really at that time collect wage data so if we were kind of a conduit for there several different departments in the the state and the federal government collect occupational data and we were kind of a conduit for the state for that um people would they wanted an hourly rate they didn want a range they didn want they uh they wanted a number and that what that was gospel but it based on survey data so and and you know there always statistical error in there and stuff and try to explain that to we spent more time uh when people call up and give information explaining this is what this really means then the just giving them the number that we spent more time doing that uh i think a lot of people don understand a lot of people don it a mindset uh uh they don wanna deal with numbers a lot of people or they want something easy and simple and that what they re looking for they don really wanna know what it means uh and a statistic under any ter uh any definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind and people don seem to understand that uh it not like you re collecting data for a hundred uh the the entire population of the entire universe you you re working with a sample trying to represent the entire universe well sometimes it good and sometimes it not they tried sampling well my brother rich was one of the families they sampled yeah and it just didn work and uh and the data they collect is just i mean well i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but the basic data has essentially how many people live in the household and what are their ages and race and that it and that not a i don think that a big secret myself but right and uh i think uh some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh is is colored by the fact that i collected data for twenty years from employers uh i a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing um yeah just lot more sympathetic to people collecting data yeah right i had did one time i had somebody call and they were doing a survey and they wanted know what i did for a living and when i told them they said well we re done we we re finished i ve i at ti at one time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but course that would have been i forty nine so that would have been probably what about twenty four so would have about twenty five years in so i be right at and ready to get the heck out anyway yknow um hum um hum plus you get so many different students and what i like just walking over here today yknow it kind of thought yknow that i wonder how many of these people i walk by yknow are gonna be here in january because yknow a lot of because i did yknow i thought well this is cool man yknow um hum uh huh yeah should been in class um hum um hum well and and and especially in my situation yknow at the i think about it quite a bit yknow if i would ve had a bachelor more of an opportunity to have a one on one uh relationship with her i probably uh uh being a girl yknow could of probably helped her out in the in a lot of socio social things social things yknow about man because i i kind of get the impression that she don really that she still ain very interested in men yknow so much as it her thing yknow so um hum so um but yknow i uh yeah i think yknow a lot of times you think well yknow um when you don even know you sit there say i only a phone call away yknow and all you do is call me but it not the same thing as being there and and she well i remember one time when she was having a stomach ache she was like uh like twelve or thirteen years old yknow and and i said well what the matter she goes uh my stomach hurts i said uh well are you on you on your period or what yknow and she goes dad i said what yknow she goes uh well i don talk i won talk to you about stuff like that i said why i i you re dad yknow for godsake she goes well that something that might talk to mom about but i wouldn talk to you about it and i said well that cool but yknow just wanted to let you know that i do know women go through that stuff yknow so um hum um hum well um hum um hum that uh it it was like i say i said she probably probably thinks the same way yknow she been here yknow and having trouble with boys and everything yknow when she was growing up but not probably would have could have probably would have been an ass about that kind of stuff you think i not how bad they were yknow if they laid a hand on her of course yknow but but uh um but by her being away yknow then and her mom got a cool head on her shoulders she wouldn let that happen unless she told me about it then she be probably be afraid tell me that i catch an airplane flight do over there or something yknow fuck the guy up or something so that uh yknow and she would have been going to northland high school which is up here just awhile up where i living at one sixty one cleveland area then uh so it would have been interesting yknow to but then yknow that then the other side of it yknow the the they think women tend to have the more emotional type of feelings than uh then men yknow we carry it on our shoulders yknow so uh yeah i just hope she adjusts um hum uh uh enjoy them now you got the terrible twos to go through which is which is cool and uh i remember one time when we got in a big argument one time when she uh when she turned teen teenager and uh i called her up and she was on the phone with somebody else and i sat there and said well yknow i calling long distance she goes so i talking to my girlfriend i said so what hang up on her and call her back you don tell me what to do i said said well okay you want to call me back well bye feel like it or something like that i think she called me ended up calling me back couple three hours later and i was pissed so i wouldn talk to her yknow little childish things that yknow well i ll pay you back yknow um hum um hum um hum um hum i don know another thing about the kids nowadays is that it uh and and devon i experienced it with her yknow so i sent her a hundred dollars one time yknow just for her and she sat there and said uh i called her up couple days later well about a week coup a cou a week later something like that and uh said what did you do with that uh what you get with that money and everything she goes well yknow i bought a gap tee shirt and i uh cd and i said um hum she goes uh what do you mean uh huh that what i bought and i said you bought a cd and you bought a blouse she goes well yeah dad they cost money i said oh lord um hum well then i think she probably took her girlfriends out to the mall yknow and partied a little bit with her mcdonald and everything that one thing i see about kids doing nowadays a lot too is uh socializing like that shopping malls and and things of that nature um hum uh huh uh i remember we uh yknow we like go to a pool hall or something yknow bar that actually yknow and they be a but we play pool yknow they wouldn let us drink or nothing because we were underage but uh that was basically the guys yknow and the girls would go over to somebody house yknow and then we meet up later on yknow and go our separate ways or we had drive ins back then yknow we go to the a movie um hum so uh as far as going shopping that wasn really something that was that big of a thing that was maybe a saturday thing with mom and dad yknow because they had the money yknow um hum um hum yeah no uh no there was more uh just getting yknow going out uh but yknow what what are you doing saturday night nothing you want to go out yeah alright we just go out yknow then if you got kiss or something yknow or god forbid you copped a feel yknow mean yknow but i mean that was different time yknow so nowadays it a lot different than that yknow um hum um hum that good uh uh um hum um hum uh yeah you slept yknow it well you can see it here i mean you can uh see some nineteen year old or eighteen year old uh guy or girl or whatever yknow and see the difference in the maturity yknow of uh another couple three different people and everything uh i don know whether me coming from like a rural farm area yknow athens and everything uh and i think it maybe has something to do with that even true today yknow you re more uh family oriented um um your fr you re friends are basically yknow you count them on your hands which you still can but uh but you socialize a lot more if you re in the city with more people and everything where if you come from like a smaller town you tend to socialize with a certain people yknow group or or whatever yknow i uh grew up in cin is this is this because it slipped i since i set it it okay um uh grew up in cincinnati i went to school at rhode island school of design went east to school um came back uh uh to uh got married and came back to uh cleveland lived there for awhile met my husband hitchhiking back from one year ah ah then when he went to graduate school in columbus i came down here and don have mister stergle with us anymore but um i stuck since seventy yeah i like it a lot uh it it changed a lot since i ve been here yknow i mean it really come a long way in terms of of the amenities of yknow restaurants and and and museums and we get all the good movies now and wexner center been a big boost and so there yknow it a whole different town than it was when i first came here but it still relatively cheap and it easy to get around and uh it got a lot going for it mm hmm yeah i a freelance artist uh illustrator in fact um marketing communications for ohio state is one is one of my big clients and um uh i also i also have various part time jobs for the medical but i mainly i mainly an artist i work in uh pen and ink and colored pencil and do mainly humorous sort of things cartoony things um i i had stuff in and there was uh a paper they used to send to parents of students i think they stopped publishing that i had stuff in that frequently um i ve had some stuff in lately and i working on football stuff right now well right now um i work third third shift at a men wear for the medical insurance yeah uh yeah and i do computer processing mostly what yknow i i work from ten at night until eight in the morning so um there not a lot of phone to do mainly it computer processing running reports and stuff no no nope it just a small independent yeah well uh the first the first thing is i think it the best thing that ever that you i best thing in the world it a wonderful neighborhood right yeah um the second thing would be uh the um cultural activities that we have um i my wexner center be one of my primary ones because there so much going on down there but the art museum and um uh oh right that cultural arts center and columbus music hall i mean there just a million things there lots of of uh theater and the third thing would be we got restaurants oh yeah i love it when people come from out of town because then i get to try new places and i way behind i need more company yeah yeah right yeah um i sort of in upper clintonville um um not so much um i for for fifteen years i lived uh down on which is more um a i i lot of artists live there but i amazed that my new street is full of artists too it just yknow older more established artists so um no no no yeah yeah lower clintonville yeah yeah yeah um uh the the the public transit system i mean i know they re doing the best they can but i don see how we re ever gonna get out of this without light rail and i really that that that the levy didn pass um let see boy i i don know i mean we got a great airport with great connections and cheap flights that no that no drawback we re not isolated um boy i don i yeah um and thi this is something i ve thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it very conservative yknow not real open to new things or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it be really competitive i i probably wouldn be working as a freelancer today i came to columbus there wasn yknow there wasn much going on when i came here and uh yknow it oh we ve got art we re open to that yknow yknow there not a big established gallery system and everything so a lot of things were just available yknow just could walk in and show anywhere and um and so i yknow i met a lot of people doing that and it i mean i st still mainly friends with the same people i met then yknow pe my my artists my age but um it been and there yknow i i don belong to any formal groups in columbus but um it a it a real strong network of people yknow everybody knows everybody yknow so it uh yknow if yo if you have a problem if you wanna talk to somebody well if if somebody you know personally doesn they know somebody who can who can help you with that so um i have work in uh gallery in the short north and also at the show of hands galleries and yeah yeah ellen at lane avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean i was really lucky to across her um they try to limit the the the uh i said i didn belong to any groups and that not true i belong to ohio designer craftsmen and um uh they tr in the in the shops they try to limit it to ohio artists but the membership is is national so it not it not really closed it just sort of focusing on ohio um i th i think it fills its niche yknow i mean i mean wexner has a niche and the and the museum has a niche and um i think it fills it very well we yeah yeah oh yeah yeah right and you know what gonna happen it only when it gets so bad that they can even walk to their car they can even go to to the store without being affected by that they can say that anymore yknow it the people that if i don see it it not there they re the ones that are gonna be the most shocked and they re the ones that are gonna be panicked when everything yknow because it getting smaller the world getting smaller we re we re more populated now than we ever have been so people need to learn to work together and to be together and gosh yknow that one of the things that i ve really yknow when i read the paper i think wow what can you do it has to start there first yknow and i think if um and i and this might be because i a woman but i think if women started running things it would be a lot different than when men run things because men tend to think yknow like the government and that kind of thing those kind of um funds that are available for different organizations and they re all geared toward things that essentially help them as a whole or help um well yeah but i mean not so much that um it always been the women responsibility to be responsible for the kids or to care about their well being and the a peaceful environment and all that kind of thing men are more let go get it and yknow we need more money and yknow they re yeah more yeah or more yknow i don i don even know because to start it just such a huge problem and it gotten so out of hand it gonna be everybody all together that has to work it gonna be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because we re so concerned about elian this this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but yknow you look at our own kids we don even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here this little kid who still has a living parent and and i don understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally yknow way out of line and yeah yeah i don i don know but it then then they second guess the mother and she risked her life and all and they they can do that i mean yknow it too bad that yknow she wasn there to to go on with what they were planning on doing but it not our right to to take other countries kids even i mean that another thing i mean come to america we ll take everyone and every yknow but then we have all these this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that all they ve grown up with is the terrorist activities and the mentality and all that they come here and if they can make it then they ll just bomb somewhere and then but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that yknow you uh you kind of wanna do a study of how long they ve been here and yknow that be interesting um i think there gotta be a line drawn and i think that um yknow if they re if they re caught um and and it any kind of crime or anything and i know they send them back but um i just think that we re just too open with that and there gotta be a line to say this is as many people as as we care to yknow i mean and i know that hard but and it hard to draw the line but then other countries if it so miserable there then they need to work on their country because whoa i yeah really um yeah one is still in high school and she she ready to she wants to go on to college so she pretty much ready to go i mean she do she got one more year of high school but uh and i held her back in kindergarten so she older graduate she ll be nineteen when she graduates and then on the other hand graduated when she was seventeen so um then my youngest daughter amy she is uh she doing real well i mean she getting really good grades a and and um with she had kind of a hard time in high school she was uh raped by a teacher in ninth grade when she first went into a school and from there it just been a nightmare of what how that it affected her yknow anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back and you say oh i wonder you know if she was like that because of this and yknow so that been a real struggle and high school i was i never really was that um excited about it for her because the memories she has she went on to a different school and she met a lot of good people there and she yeah yeah ever authority figures at all yknow she she really strong about that though because um she doesn look at anybody being be uh yknow maybe more wiser more experienced in things but yknow certainly she doesn trust anybody yeah yeah and that the thing about schools too yknow i totally disagree with uniforms yknow unless it all slacks all of it because you get the the girls in the uniforms and they re short and they can enforce that they don enforce that and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row i should have went and met him or i should have said hey yknow hey this uh yknow haven met me and i and i really yknow fault myself for that but it made me more aware too and i yknow when you look at someone and you say oh you would never dream that they well i do yknow there isn anything i don put past anybody doing i really don cause they just yeah oh no no i do because there some good ones out there there some bad ones too but yknow yeah um it awareness again i mean yknow put two and two together you get some young teachers right out of of college and then you put em with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean you can even you can control the attraction there but you can be aware of it and you can you can um put the put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and yknow and they ve got stairs up and down and yknow they get in their lockers and they bend over yknow and that that just too much i mean i think that the first thing that has to be done take away that yknow they shouldn even be uh that shouldn even be a thought yknow and it distracting enough for the the guys their own age but then you put these young teachers in there maybe they re single guys that were just had a hell of a time in hall in college and then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh well yknow you gotta look at that you gotta be more aware um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory um sexual harassment tapes and and you learn you teach the girls that it not what they do it how they make you feel is is constituted as your uh yeah harassment there and they re too afraid and then besides that they yknow there crushes on yknow you can fault the girls for having crushes and things like that they re going through enough things as it is but you can make them aware if somebody as an adult steps over that line or makes them uncomfortable yknow there should be some kind of a a system to where these girls the slightest bit yknow it anonymous it yknow probably but they don they won yknow part of is they feel flattered part of it is like wow the yknow this guy thinks i nice looking or whatever no yeah the they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the deduction allowances because even when we reduced deductions it went down too yeah yeah and then again uh you say well yknow like well maybe some affluent uh person would donate and it publicized donate so much don know okay well that you remember back sometime in may were ninety percent tax brackets and so forth so that means ninety cents on that dollar he gave they didn br they didn bring that up he only gave ten cents again it gets back to the ten percent tithing and um i think there something else in the bible where you know she the lady gives gives only a small portion compared to a larger portion but in relation to what her income was that meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need promote more of that if we re going package things materialize we need to think more of that but i think really take hold of the night what would you be doing if you re a third world country didn have choice you why you be doing eight children and trying to feed eight children and it if you re here in a this country any eight children why you have eight children to start with shouldn you have little more knowledge little more support around you educating knowing self discipline and on what on really on top what really in crazy is when you have multiple fathers and the children don know the dads that comes back to the lack of our morals and the lack of self and our society promotes it they re doing a to tax laws in our uh all the government you see government do this government doing it to themselves well i again gets back to being in the home did your mother give you everything you wanted then she failed you didn she not really well according to the government she would have and you don the problem is as a youngsters you grow up you don realize how much your parents did for you until you re probably until you re about thirty forty you don realize my goodness mom and dad you made a sacrifice because now i learning a little more what you did and then by the time you re uh maybe sixty fifty sixty now you got stay take care of your parents if you have the morals to do it otherwise just ship them off to the farm and there people like that today still you go but i think people should go to um retirement centers uh huh uh and uh sit down make a visit to them every week make it part of life and develop a friendship you learn a heck a lot from that uh aging person a heck a lot more than you would through interviewing me really no no i living yeah that my my di my um role call yeah yeah and uh that the generation i talking about those are generation th they they went through the depression and so forth they they were the i i i pity i feel sorry for your generation which is my daughter generation and uh part of my son i because um i i i don see how in the heck the wages aren going up that much prices are up consumerism going up somewhere along the uh the consumer is going to have to start getting a little wiser and say well what do i want out of life the trouble is if he does get wiser too much he usually about forty years of age and he says gosh darn it i wish i listened it it would be interesting to see how much of your generation is saving first of all how much they earning how much they expect to pay for a house and all these other things know they they say to you why well i ll save ten percent church then you got oh gee five dollars here thr or may twenty cents a twenty cents an hour you this you figure all those up all these campaigns you hear during course a year i often thought it would be great for marketing take all those figures and add up and see if it adds up to a hundred percent and if it does then where are your goals see when i bought a house the financier came in i went to his office and he said oh mister no problem no problem you can get that house i said i can yeah you re professional and you re wife professional i said that how you re evaluating it on both of us yes i said then i don want to do business with you why i going give you a loan i said i don want do business with you because you didn ask me about my goals my goals was not to have my wife work because nowadays takes two of them to work i der wondering when they re going to child labor law uh revoke that because with two of them working i wondering how many more hours a day you can squeeze out of a couple personal life so they ll have sanity at some time in their life to enjoy life when these people start realizing hey we it i we re chasing our tails then those two coup that that couple got wise and said hey we re going to do with less and we re going go for quality when that when that couple reaches that mentality mister loan officer you re gonna have a greater society to work with and you won have as many repossessions i sorry it goes against your goal but goes against it it more positive for our society and that been it my wife been working part time all her tenure that fine keep her license up she a nurse the thing is i don want i didn want her i wanted her to be home with the kids i didn want somebody else to rear our kids and i don know if our kids realize this or not but i do know my my my brother in law mentioned to his uh parents he said gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he just turned fifty and they don have any kids and he says wow i don know how you did it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrificing and when you sacrifice it becomes i makes you more humble and it makes you a a better person because you got the spirituality inside you driving you and that what gonna take you home i often ask of people uh you ask me about marketing ho uh do you think there a heaven and how do you picture it yeah okay see the way i look at heaven myself is that i have a chance to meet all my acquaintances i had over the past my family and i ll see them face to face and i ll recognize them and they ll recognize me but something transcends them because as i look to them unlike when they re on earth my goodness we re taught to learn the most negative thing about person psychology says if you see a blank sheet of paper you see the dot on the thing you don see the other ninety nine percent of the paper you see that dot it gonna be just the opposite in heaven i can think of a negative thing about you and the reason why you can think of a negative thing about them because you see christ appearance coming through them and they see the same thing it mirrored back to them because we re made in christ images and we can say no to him that what heaven like that what we should go to bed at night thinking what did we do positive today and build on the positive it may be the smallest part of that sheet of paper i made a difference i helped someone no every once in awhile with my grandmother she always wanted me to become a nurse and i was a senior in high school when she died and sometimes i think boy she really like it that i was a nurse because i still use her bloodpressure cuff an everything she had given me her bloodpressure cuff i mean it very old mm hmm yes no in germany mm hmm during the depression my grandfather um moved over here and then asked her to marry him and she moved over and they settled in springfield ohio and then my mom met my father um he was from pataskala they met here at where they re going to college and they settled here in columbus okay small world must have yes so i think that what i recall missing i know my sometimes i mean we ve taken joey out to the cemetery a few times to go to the gravesite of his father and he says yknow very often boy she would really liked to have been here and done things with him he an aeronautical engineer um he started off here in columbus at janitrol they went out of business then he went to urbana for grimes aerospace um they ended up merging in now there really no aerospace things in columbus he working for in plane city which is um uh kind heating and cooling air conditioning systems and so he using his airflow design not on airplanes but on heating and cooling systems yes there a huge wind tunnel yeah i don know if it where it is but i definitely remember him talking about doing different experiments and projects in the tunnel sort of and kind of yes we were i mean dated in high but he ended up going to prom with somebody else and we mean we we went to ki went kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom an his mom were campfire leaders together and the whole bit and then we didn really and um kind of really didn get together at all freshman year he did go to school here and then um as i said i swam for ohio state and then i went into agler davidson a sporting goods store to um buy a swimsuit my sophomore year and he was a cashier there and we started again and it was just like we hadn missed any time and started dating sophomore year again and ended up getting married after i finished my master eighty eight so we ju we just had our eleventh wedding anniversary yeah i can it that way i mean personally i i i i don know there so much i know about him and things i trust because i ve known him forever there so many i don think people are as honest and truthful these days i don know i would have a hard time really getting into a relationship with somebody that i met today not knowing everything about him why do i think that is um oh i would say family values customs traditions um divorce moving just looking at my sister my my sister i mean she very happily married but my god i mean they they lived here in columbus he from dallas they met here they moved to indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back now they re in london england they ve been married what four five years and i think they ve lived six different places they re just constantly on the they just don have the connection with the family and i don know if that a bad thing it just they aren right and and you aren as close to your family and the traditions and the and i think you lose all of that and then you get so wrapped up in work and moving that i don think kids have the center base to the family that they used to have and i don know the the culture is just so fast paced that i don are maybe it not honesty maybe it just they don have as much time to get attached they re ready to move on again you just don get as close to people as you used to yeah right right i can argue both of that i at a luxury i guess where we re at a position where i i truly don have to work so if i ever felt that he was in jeopardy or he wasn getting what he wanted or needed i would quit in a heartbeat to to take care of that but having family with him the first year and a half um i don know i got all my schooling everything out of the way i cut down to the sixty percent when he was born to have more time with him um i don know it a whole different society with emails and the computer and the internet and ju the cell phones i mean it in some regards it much more connected but so impersonal and i think i don know mom being outside the home i think so many families are forced to do that with the cost and is it the cost or is it the wants it the very material society right now but it also a very um good economical time too the stock market overall been up i know it down right now but overall so the money been flying houses and buildings and right i mean pal is booming it uh and i think personally i could not have put him in daycare when he was an infant and i think i would have quit if a family would not have been available but since family was available and i think he very social i think he was ready for the interaction with the other kids and three days a week isn right right my husband drops him off and i pick him up so he there for the shortest amount of time it probably family by family i mean that we that why i was a little bit late leaving work the way it was there the they we ve got two coworkers one um has her child at same day care as as myself she about a year now and and listening to her and i mean she there you know sixty seventy hours a week i mean she dropped off at six a and not picked up till six thirty and she fine with that me personally there no way because somebody is totally in my opinion raising that child you aren getting to put your values your traditions what important to you onto that child now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been in day care now for three weeks and she gonna go she she gonna quit her job and go to um um night working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him um hum right after high school i think there was probably i ll say six and amazingly uh well three were still together um and it was nice uh just seeing that and you could tell they were still in love and everything and yknow one of them had four children one had like six yknow i mean it was amazing because i thought i bet they re not still married getting right out of high school i just wasn interested in that when i was in high school at all yknow i was ready to go out into the world and these girls who get married so young they just have no clue about life you know you know i think a lot of it depends on i don know if it different parts of the country but cultures and everything because you know it just seems in ah some parts of the midwest but maybe kentucky and west virginia seems girls down there a lot them get married so young they just that just what they want to do yknow they don but they re not thinking of any future wanting to go to college or anything like that have to cough is that okay i sorry i didn want be like you ll you ll know it me by the cough um no i have a beautiful niece i love her to death um i knew at a young age and actually wanted to make it a permanent decision but doctors at that time wouldn do it i was like twenty five and i knew no they wouldn even consider it they said you ll change your mind and i knew i just never felt a mother instinct and it funny uh yesterday actually last night we went to visit a friend of ours had a baby yesterday two days ago and when we left the room and she has a two year old child and now another little girl um i said derek you know it it nice to go in there and see that but i just have no motherly instinct towards you know they re all like oh eric you should have one and yknow and he knows knows i not going to have um i just knew at a young age i ve always loved the animals and i it just i know it sounds crazy but i rather have ten animals and take care of them and different kinds of animals than children i don know why i knew at a very young age that i wasn important to me it wouldn be a part of my life they wouldn no i went to two different doctors and they said you possibly will change your mind and yknow i was single um maybe if i would have been married they might have considered it um but they said no way would they do it and we re talking fifteen years ago yeah isn that amazing yeah right well it probably would have been yeah but they felt that i would change and uh i ve also been a vegetarian for twenty two years and when i first decided to do that everyone said oh you ll change wait until you get married you ll you know and i don eat any animals at all um and it it was just a conscious um decision i i never liked meat my parents always made me eat it once i went away to college and i said i i not going to eat anymore and they re like oh well we ll see and i ve never eat eaten anything since and i ve always felt good about it but people always said oh you don even crave yknow what like a wendy hamburger and all this stuff and once you make a decision like that you don crave things like that you don even think about it um and i yknow they said well what if uh for health reason they said you have to eat meat there no way someone could tell me that i would have to eat meat yknow to make me healthier or whatever because i ve always been really healthy um hum um hum um hum um hum right there is there didn used to be and especially in restaurants and everything and now it such an open market and they know that they have to accommodate every um body taste yknow i mean before no i have to go in to a restaurant and salad and baked potato yknow i mean there was nothing really nothing unless i go to a buffet and then all the food so cooked down i mean honestly yknow it like no nutritional value but um no i knew i wouldn change my mind on that either i pretty strong willed about oh yeah and you know what i cook meat for my husband i really don cook red meat because he on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups a lot of good soups for him with meat and it really doesn bother me to cook it yknow i not go sit home make a roast every night but um and he limited his meat a little bit more but with men it a lot harder i think yknow when they re used to you meat and potato kind of families um but like thanksgiving it just doesn mean that much to me i i the family thing does but yknow the turkey and all we i don cook it very often my sister we used to go to my sister house because she enjoys cooking and makes it a little bit easier i tend to overcook the meat you know i haven yeah i haven tried that no no i eat tofu a little bit but not really that much and i probably sit should i ve um tended to more to soy products and there so much nutritional value and especially for women yknow i think it really um hum i think it really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago all these women i know um hum um hum right right um hum and they should and very rarely do doctors even ask you about allergies and i more and more and people don even realize and they get sick so often they need to ask about allergies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people when they can figure out what wrong with them because a lot of times it is allergic reactions to things they ve eaten or been around you know but um more i think doctors should more look on that avenue yknow that possibly it something else like that i ve never had a doc well now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you if you know about allergies and usually it um prescriptions and things you know i mean that you ve taken but they i don know i think a lot of things have to do with food allergies anymore i really do yep well for so long i ate peanuts and i loved them and peanut butter and then two years ago i started getting a reaction from it and um finally i did go to the doctor because i i i was so ill from it um and he said you re allergic um mainly it was the skins on like spanish peanuts and things and i never but my body must have built up this reaction to it because i i was always fine eating them and then they really turned on me so now i can even eat any peanut products or the oil because everybody like well you can eat natural peanut butter and i like no it the oil in there you know they grind up the peanuts and it the oil but um i probably had it for a long time and i was getting sick and thinking i had the flu or something and he yknow i didn realize because i used to love peanut butter you want toast and crackers i go home you know was because it was a lot of protein for me not eating meat and it yknow it kind of satisfied me but um this doctor took a couple tests and um he realized it was the peanuts which i would have never thought of that because i ate it for so long all my life yes um hum see and i can eat seafood but i tried some once when i went to las vegas with my and i we didn really have it my mom didn cook it at home which i kind glad she didn um the smell of fish always kind of bothered me but until i tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes i broke out into a rash i mean it was like a heat rash oh it started on my neck is it okay i sorry it started on my neck and went down but it was automatic and i mean they had to take me the emergency room i didn know what it was until it was and i mean you get so hot and you you just you re in a fever so i haven been able to eat that but luckily my husband he allergic too she was but i had admired her more yeah because um uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again that gonna be the litmus test and it just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party they would nominate such people as uh mcgovern who hadn yknow who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hardline left of center liberal stance for more of a moderate middle of the road because it easier to get that sold to the american public um so uh while i think dole was correct um i think she yeah she shot herself in the foot i don she would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is being controlled by the extreme right wing which is a problem for the republicans they moved they need to move towards the middle which i think george is trying to do um uh uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell i tell them yes and i an in uh an indifferent liberal um hum um hum right if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but yknow and in in election times a weekend is a couple of centuries uh uh a year is an eon so anything can happen between now and then but i think uh dole had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate uh which is basically where clinton placed himself in the two elections he ran in um most real democrats the warren beatty of the world and many yknow congressmen and senators dislike clinton because di didn they didn think he was democratic enough um i liked clinton because as i said over the years i ve learned that extremes in either party don get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you hafta find someone who a moderate and can can appeal to everybody i used to tell school districts when i went in to tell them how to to put together a school levy campaign that basically you had the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my age but that there was about thirty percent of the people who were were for you with the yes votes thirty percent who were automatically against you the no votes and thirty percent in between i told them ignore the no votes yknow just just don get them upset with you you don want them yknow working actively against you lock up your thirty that are with you make sure you yknow you do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i call them you had to massage them and that what clinton did so well and that what dole could have done i not sure if george is gonna be able to uh because to get the the nomination eventually he gonna come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i anti abortion i pro gun he already said the pro gun and that because it going against what most americans are saying dole i think represented where most americans are if you look at opinion polls um so yknow you hafta find a way to to moderate that stance uh whether you re republican or a democrat oh yeah i think it possible it have to take the right combination of uh someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people i think dole would have been a good candidate i would have been hard pressed i mean uh to some of her issues i don like but when she came out uh and said her her her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns uh she went up a notch couple of notches in in in my estimation because i wasn sure where she be i thought she have to sell herself as hardline with the hardline republicans and then i wouldn have been able to vote for her um hum except you couldn come right out and say you wouldn you didn want to vote for her because she was a woman there have to be an under current i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed they re the older citizens um many in my generation uh they just probably be because i i the early baby boom i i the first of the baby boom uh and that when the woman movement started and many men there still haven always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students um there there a a whole world of difference between their attitudes in a lot of things and yknow women minority issues uh they just second hand to them it it doesn yknow it not like it was for us which was a sea change for them it normal so and more of those people are in the voting population if they would vote yknow you have to find a candidate who would know how to do what clinton did in ninety two and get out that college vote that that um that an interesting question because he was a a serious contender last time i haven heard his name this time um what people say they would do th yknow that they like him because he is um intelligent charismatic uh all those th those neat things that you need to to be elected today um and a lot of people said they would vote for him but what they say in polls they don know if it would translate over but yeah i think he could i think the right candidate could and i think mike coleman this year uh in the columbus race showed that i mean he crossed gender lines he crossed um party lines he crossed over into all of the city and winning even dorothy teater precinct which surprised me yknow and and not by just a little small margin i think it was two hundred and some votes which is pretty substantial ri well right yeah well teater a school board member for columbus yeah um hum right that that really hard to say um if she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran negatives don work in columbus columbus really does have a heart and that just doesn play in columbus what plays in the state and and the people who ran her campaign ran voinovich campaign and betty montgomery campaign and and that negative stuff worked statewide that doesn work so well in columbus um i i think that it even a younger woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost um and i like to think that age doesn matter but she came across as old to me also and i like to think i not prejudiced on on any issue but if there uh someone who had been right on the issues i don care if she was old i would have voted for her she just didn support the issues i supported she was wrong on uh i i didn like that she tried to use um the police chief in such a negative way by saying that um coleman had voted for a raise for the chief well yes he voted for a raise for the chief but he voted for a raise for the the police officers it just that yknow the police chief was tied to his and i don like people who try to manipulate facts uh and and that was manipulating the facts i didn like that she was um uh uh ag against the the the tiff uh and polaris once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong and i don think it was wrong to begin with but once it was voted and in place i thought our reputation was on the line and for her to try to use another divisive issue just to get elected didn sit well with me um so i don even if she had a lot of charisma charisma doesn mean as much to me as a person stand one two three four five six seven eight nine i ve yeah i ve been here pretty much all my life until just recent weeks when i moved up to it it a real comfort yknow comfort for me because everybody pretty much around where we useta live just yknow it gets worse and worse was well it yknow the crime you can really stop and other things that happen just yknow too much partying around i mean that why i left twelfth because i couldn yknow but yknow just everybody uh the neighbors being loud and everything and my mom older so she can really put up with any of that and well i lived on twelfth maybe about four or five years ago probably longer but that was just for a summer thing yknow after i saw all the couches being burned i said yknow what i yeah they was burning couches and uh over by pearl alley they was actually rolling a volkswagen down the man there was all kinds of people doing it just people coming from high street and just happen happen to be centralized right there on twelfth avenue yeah pretty much yeah easy come easy go follow the leader monkey in the middle whatever oh that was a football game deal uh i think they lost think ohio state lost because they was just out there ranting and raving and after a while it got out of hand and i i had to pack it up uh a little bit north of north broadway right along the freeway there um didn useta be a bad neighborhood but now it just kind of you got the little kids growing up and doing shit that yknow you picture yourself doing as a child one way or another yknow now you throw rocks around and stuff and accidentally break a window run away well yeah it i just give you a rough estimate of uh two and a half miles from here well it was both really because there be kids lived there since i lived there that was thirteen years ago huh and being that long in the same neighborhood just doesn really get it with me yeah it got boring it got frustrating because we uh you get these new people moving in and yknow you re used to everything being nice yknow and then got people next door breaking into you or upstairs from you breaking into each just well yeah we got broke into uh i think twice and stuff got stolen my trucks been broken into my moms cars been broken into the gas siphoned pretty much everybody around there been uh criminalized one way or another it seems like it just about everywhere on that street is uh one way or another criminal well number one it a little bit smaller more controlled area quiet no less and uh get my mom closer to the sister yknow my sister lives up there she moved there from uh down in west virginia so yknow with mom having all the peace and peace and quiet she know plus in a place that only year old yknow just apartments we was living it just god i mean seems like a hundred years old fire hazards no over on um beulah you know where that over by north broadway where i said so yeah those places were probably about thirty years old i th no fire hazards insulation just yknow fire hazard everywhere yeah it it a change of pace and plus being around my sister instead of yknow taking a twenty mile lag all the way out there just go a couple blocks over and there she is yeah i actually have bunch of numbers here that hope i didn lose yeah i got uh three people to call see about jobs there should be in within middle the week yeah because gas money i can do construction cooking actually took columbus public schools cooking test and passed it so i technically a cook oh i can whip up a mean fish especially when i go out we re closer to the fishing area now i caught dinner the other night and uh heck just about anything i can make turn i like to get a patent on a certain kind of omelet i not gonna yknow yeah well it just uh yknow grilled cheese omelet yknow it make it like grilled cheese except omelet and cheese and all your goodies inside yeah got a little secret recipe to throw in a little bit of this and that into tastes pretty good too yeah it a good growing area the job prospects are um little scarce yknow because the smaller town but yeah there only about a one percent unemployment rate there yeah that what i said today i i the one percent that unemployed right yeah yeah there uh some people there just get lazy then you got the college students they i don know how many of them work but most of them there just from out of town westland that up in delaware and uh most of them that i talk to yknow i haven been there a while so i haven really talked to a whole population of students but the ones i did talk to even they re yknow professor and whatever they re majoring in we was out yknow and hanging out at the bar they was doing karaoke oh man you should ve saw them do hang on yeah he was up there too the old guy with beard and uh tweed jacket yknow it was pretty cool and uh they said most yknow most of the students are not even from delawere yeah most of them some of them transfer from up north and out east and indiana and just different walks of life yknow yeah most of them do yknow and then yknow pretty much the rest of them just hang out go to school well yeah well you get a lot of those yeah most them think the freshman class just ride along i think the freshmen tougher would be cutoff little bit tougher yknow it be tougher to be walking around knowing different areas like me i didn know where this hall was i was out there with fifty million halls around me and just stopped once and i said where lazenby and they that way not too far from where i parked no i parked over here on uh uh me see the a section goes back in um hum yeah mm hmm okay i think so feels like it too close to my mouth really but all right mm hmm mm hmm pretty much uh lived here my whole life uh i was born in sunbury and raised in gahanna and was in the service uh for four years uh so i actually came back here in nineteen seventy two and i been here since then i was born in nineteen fifty uh august twenty fifth and i divorced and i have a daughter be nineteen this year and then they live in saint louis mm hmm she ll be nineteen in september far as i know she was planning on going to uh saint louis university which i want her to go to missouri university of missouri but but it a uh smaller catholic school yknow within saint louis so mm hmm i work at uh company plus i help out at the a vietnam veteran association uh packing just working the maint i in the uh warehouse packing stuff and uh in the a i just kind of do what needs be done yknow help people out no i wasn in vietnam but i was in during that time mm hmm mm hmm i was stationed uh permanent duty station was in north carolina uh yknow i was wor i was in like missiles and stuff so um mm hmm mm hmm well i was i was uh received my notice of drafting to uh to be drafted uh greetings yknow you re gonna be drafted but my brother had just got back couple three years from vietnam so i enlisted in the air force mm hmm i went to for about three months but i just got out of school you know how it is no i didn i know i didn wanna go to school and partying sounded pretty good so so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up flunking out of uh in the in the first three months of the first quarter so uh then i got my notice in january so mm hmm um hum um hum about my brother being in there uh being over there and everything yknow he he was uh pretty upset that i did uh that i did that yknow that i just went ahead and flunked out of school and uh and and he said yknow enlist in something don go in the damn army yknow so yeah he knew it was a bullshit war um hum much um um hum right well a long time ago uh when they had en signed the declaration and everything they said yknow build a fence around your place and and take care of your own yknow and i think basically that the way the philosophy should be i think there times when you need to be when we need to go help out other people but we try to be too much of a policeman now mm hmm you get into a situation where you really where there a no win situation from the get go and uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we went over there to do initially it would ve worked out okay but we weren so so it became a political war as everybody knows that knows anything about it mm hmm yeah there was a lot of positive things uh from it as far as discipline as far as uh uh growing up faster and everything yknow sometimes when i see a girl like my daughter or like other other people at that age yknow and everything i yknow they tend to act grown up yknow or i felt like i was forced to grow up yknow a little bit faster uh but and then in then when i get out of service like at twenty two yknow i was kind of like behind everybody yknow as far as my age group and stuff that didn have to go and uh so i had had a lot of uh good times as far as that goes and yknow cleanliness and next to godliness and all that stuff yknow i mean a lot of people don there just a lot of lax stuff goes on today in my opinion but mm hmm mm hmm well i i think that my opinion is that if you ain going to school and you re not going you re not working and everything you should uh be doing something besides causing problems yknow and a lot of kids that all they really wanna do nowadays is just cause aggravation to people the lack of discipline at the home well i ve been th see i wasn much i my being here and my daughter being there i didn really have the uh time with her that i wished i would ve had yknow but uh uh her mother would yknow wouldn did her all right and everything but i wished that i would ve been more involved in her growing up and i think two people families are generally better yknow for not necessarily living being lo yknow its about being married and everything but at least being able to be a part of their your kid mm hmm mm hmm well i believe it quality not quantity uh ideally yknow um one parent would be there be it male or female well yknow man or wi man or wo or lady but uh but yknow your quality time more important yknow maybe go come home and you and all you wanna do is sit down and start watching tv or drinking beer or whatever yknow and not spend any time with your child it doesn matter wheth you re there all day or whether you re there for two hours well i believe that way it was originally set up you know so mm hmm i personally don believe that they should be allowed to because i believe they they should have the male gender as well as the female gender for a proper bringing up balance hum um i don see any reason for it myself but uh that interesting uh um yknow when they when the first when the uh when time began yknow according my uh what i believe in and everything yknow it was man and woman got married yknow and and reason they got married was because of procreation yknow keep the keep the uh population going uh i think that the way it was set up originally so i have no problem with a man being with a man or woman being with a woman but um if if that was the relationship for everybody uh then obviously the the civilization gonna be dead yknow so mm hmm mm hmm well i ve i ve had gay friends and uh uh one of them worked at a and and he retired and then uh and the other one was on a disability and everything so uh that never even came up in their relationship nor did it come up in uh a another couple friends that i ve had yknow that they uh they more or less took care of each other yknow so i don agree with it we had gays in there when i was in there yknow so yeah i mean you generally could i mean they didn broadcast it obviously but yknow they uh i mean my personally would i would personally wouldn care yknow as long as uh if i was in a foxhole with somebody i could care less whether he is gay or not as long as he shoot a gun yknow to help me out if i was in trouble so i think it good and uh i ve yknow i think women are are capable of doing that my only disagreement with it is that i have a real problem being in that foxhole and have a woman beside me and uh she get shot yknow i don know how i could deal with that it be it men i don know if you you you women have yknow different feelings but with about each other than they do with men and men have different feelings about each other uh than they do with women and everything and they tend to be more protective so um where a man yknow you kind of feel like he can carry his own weight yknow a woman you may not you may feel like you have to do a special thing in order to uh uh to keep her from getting killed yknow or something or just shot or something so i wouldn personally i don like that myself but i ain had no problem with them being like a pilot or something like that yknow i wouldn like it to be that way but uh basically when i was in the service the ta the women uh had their own area of the service that they were allowed to be basically nurses and stuff yknow uh i think people are still fairly racist i don think it near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can say i blame the white community so much for it i would say it probably both the white and i guess any other race relation fault um i mean as far as like if you look at the black communities things like that you have like um you have like the united negro college fund things like that where they re almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they re geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community because they re not giving out equal opportunity to the people that need em um it sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had they re white organizations or what not um and i think it sort of going along the same lines where there is still a problem of it but i think it has gotten better at least if nothing else um i think i think for the most part people could handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like more the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone under the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i don think it caused any huge problems or anything like that uh yeah um yes and no they re kind of weird like that um one set of grandparents really i can hear ever says anything there a set on the other side that they are a little bit more racist um but at the same time it i don know they almost set up like a double standard for black people there are black people that they really like and i mean they re actually friends with some black people and there are black people that they don like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they re racist towards i mean it the same thing that goes with white people obviously there are white you can stand they re white people that are just obnoxious and you don wanna deal with um i mean it basically the same thing right yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly um i really don think we do for the most part i can say i see any real big problems or anything like that that occur just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would ve caused a bigger problem than the black president um honestly um although i don really see too many sexist problems i definitely do see guys still be more like the decision making type and as being like the final say in things rather than women and i would see them having an authority figure that being a woman as causing problems to em i think they would a bigger problem with it yeah um like i said it just be the old generations with the black president where now it be part of all generations that would still have a problem with it and i think that be a bigger number then would be with a black president and i think it would cause problems um i don know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it but i definitely could see here definitely would think that people would be arguing about it yelling about it and making a bigger deal about it um probably for the most part i mean as long as they have a political background of some sort i can say i see any real difference i mean for the most part they ve proven to be able to do anything else any guy can do so um hum no i not really i mean i don think they come to any more difficult conclusions than guys had coming up to uh yeah no not at all no um honestly no i pretty shy for the most part so those more types of women i can say i really ever had a relation with or whatever unfortunately although i don like it yeah i don know i just i a pretty indecisive person i don like making decisions and she kind of the same way so when it comes to what we re going to do or whatever it takes us hours to decide what we re going to do and i mean it just gets us nowhere i mean even some place as simple as you know where to go out to eat or whatever we ll spend a good half hour forty five minutes just driving around till we actually decide a place or someone says something or whatever so what that um i met her in high school she still in high school and i in college so um yes and no i mean as far as the experience goes i mean i don live on campus so i don get the entire college experience you know the whole dorms and events going place on campus it more things about pick and choose that i wanna do on campus i come down for um so i can really say it anything too drastic i mean obviously it kind of weird when people are asking what you re doing and you re like oh i going to you know high school prom something i have parts a little little awkward but i mean i can say it it really any different or anything um hum um hum i honestly don think that that really has much to do with it obviously it does put the idea in the kids heads but it been there for a long time um i mean obviously i mean that how little boys are or whatever i mean obviously being uh being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing even things like football or whatever i mean it you see something you thought it was neat so you do it or whatever i mean it goes back more towards the curious nature of kids where i mean i can say there anything really different yknow we ll go places yknow um we went to the we go to the playground take my dog to the playground we ll go shopping grocery shopping um yeah yeah i haven taken him there yet see i i he a he just he in his twos and i like he got to be in a cart or something well because when i holding his hand and taking him he just tends to want to he not calm and collective he a little yknow um so like that why we don do nothing because when i take him to people houses he i can do that because he ll get into everything and i um i get real stressed out about that i don i don so i like yeah i do that i i make him sit yknow time out well now for two minutes when he was one just for one minute my mother taught me that um i don sti i don stand him in the corner or anything like that i do smack his hands um because he he likes he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit people and i smack his hands for that and i try not to yell but it not to yell i try to talk to him talk to him like yknow this be nice dan um yeah well yeah when he was i don remember how many months it went on for like two months where he just cried it might have been colic or whatever but he gus cried and yep i no um hum he know well you when you become a mother you tend to ignore things too so i guess i mean that went well that was really really hard for me i i would uh call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed but i don know i couldn tell you what he went through with that crying spell but he did go hu where he just did not quit crying but eventually it went away i just i just because i would get stressed out and start crying and go crazy yknow and my mother was always there for me i would just call my mom like hey what can i do and she just like calm down rachel just calm down and yeah yeah yeah no hum um well i work in the accounting department i a accounting assistant so i pretty much um it not stressful at all uh i it really easy it not challenging hardly at all which i yknow it actually my family business so um i started working there to help them out but yknow as i been working there for a while i been want to move up yknow so i mean i all for anything i could do the sales i could do yknow the purchasing i can do i i pretty much can do anything that will be i can be taught to do no not at this job no i did have a job like that when i worked full time i was the receptionist and that was very stressful not not really much of the um answering the phones and stuff it was more of the um my um employer and my employees that i worked with it it was just that pretty much i worked with um adults that act like we were in high school and it was groupie yknow and i not like that i try to get along with everybody and and it was just i never ended up fitting in with everybody and just things were gossip and i don go for that and i ended up quitting that job and i felt like i yknow cou should have stuck in there but i i couldn deal with it anymore i mean i go home yknow want to cry i mean it just these were all adults older than me and it it was just it was really silly yeah i mean it it was just yi yeah talking about me and i would hear it from it was just really childish and i would just hear things it is it was very much high school and i worked there a year and i just couldn deal with it no more i couldn deal with not never seeing my kid because i did work five days a weeks and then every third saturday i worked also which i made good money and i wou need to make money again but i happier yknow yes i will go back to full time most definitely when he in school um if i could find something part time that pays more that what i looking for to do but full time i wouldn mi definitely go back when he in school that how i would like ti to be uh i ve thought about that it sad i i ve i mean that why i haven went to college or anything because there was nothing my mind is set on that i want to do in life i just want to be rich i mean yknow i have little thoughts of like i like tsiz to design um maybe a designer but yknow like i went to a i i was in police i wa uh law enforcement i th went the went there for career center in high school and that was something that was exciting for me but that totally out of the question for me now because i have a kid and there no way i would do that yeah and yeah and i wouldn do that i if i was yknow had no children and maybe it was a law enforcement career center and i mean no it was during school um you go there you went there for two years your junior and senior year and um like your junior you go in the morning and your senior you go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you re at the career center and then you go well law enforcement you start out and you do exercises for like two hours so i was like in shape very well i was in very good shape disciplined i would be screamed at made get jumped on the floor to do pushups i mean it was it was it was just like that i telling you it was and we would see th yknow they would put things on the tel on the screen for us to watch i was i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was very a very good experience i went through very good yeah there were some of them didn end up dropping out yeah probably yeah well i think a few of them have um i don know because i haven got kept in contact with them i think i know of a couple that have went on but i not sure about the rest yeah yeah yeah um hum i picked um legal secretary also but i chose law enforcement over that because i got accepted to that too yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i i i guess i like to do it but and i probably i don know yeah um hum um hum oh white women who had actually had it done than uh than um hispanic or african american but i don know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the government i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean there money involved but it it not so much money that it would radically change your life in a sort of yknow it not thousands of dollars if it was two hundred i believe and and that yknow i mean if if that amount of money is going to sway you in that direction i don know i think yknow there is the debate about ten years down the line but wha yknow is there going to be something that going to make them change yknow what is it yknow what is it going to be and like how how realistic is it for yknow what percentage i mean i don know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that but i mean i do think if there is that element of choice it a lot different than yknow the government saying okay this is your cut off limit but i mean the statistics they were gi giving on um the average number of children that these women were having and yknow yknow the average number of children that were just taken to the hospital and left there or yknow just dropped off wherever and and the state these children were in and their lifespan and everything else i mean yknow there the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the the child life yknow i mean i think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and yknow the same is in england yeah everyone saying oh because they were talking about yknow i mean again was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of yknow somehow sort of forcing these young girls to at least be on birth control yknow in whatever way and and again that everyone was up in arms but it sort of like yknow what is that child quality of life gonna be when their mothers just yknow right right um hum oh yes definitely in england too um hum hm um hum right um i don i mean there definitely is that image of yknow dallas and dynasty i think it it worse i think for the the image of the tourist like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded yknow and that was sort of another thing when yknow i went to school there is yknow i had a scholarship that how i went there yknow and i worked the whole time i was in highschool in college and all this kind of thing but it was just like yeah people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and yknow they just jh sort of don grasp the fact that yknow you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films yknow i remember actually being in bristol and that film california with brad pitt and juliette lewis and yknow they re in the trailer and everything else and yknow their accent and and i remember a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of lounge room watching this and they said like oh yknow something like is that what they talk like or is that what it like in the south and i thought oh my yknow what an image to have of like the south and yknow i was just kind of shocked at this but i think that there yknow with yknow people who are going to university there and things like that there isn necessarily that opinion maybe yknow in a certain sector like when all you ve heard is the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think yknow most people like me or whatever they well i shouldn say like but yknow people who have more education sort of not even without having to really think about it but yknow there isn just that blatant view i mean i think that it is um the consumption thing like i think a lot more realize now that yknow i think americans have this just reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending and like obviously when you give that a closer look so many people are in debt i mean i think i just saw something else on the news that said yknow across the board we don even break even we re like negative one or something right right right credit cards right exactly exactly absolutely oh yeah i know and that actually a really interesting thing too because especially coming back yknow and moving all my stuff out of storage i ve just been on this yknow i getting rid of half of everything i own because over there it yknow it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so loaded down especially when i ve spent so much time just living out of a suitcase yknow i just really realize i have so much stuff that i don need because there yknow everyone has just sort of like a little closet with clothes yknow there isn stuff all around everything is more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it like yknow picture frames or something there might be yknow twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here oh yknow they re five dollars a piece lets buy five yknow yeah exactly um well i think the price has a lot to do with it because i mean that what i see see over there that prevents it yknow there a sort of middle of the line dress that would be like at the limited here or something is yknow seventy five pounds yknow at like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that a lot yknow you see them in the limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but yknow really if you buy that you re not really gonna be buying yknow more than one or like anything else for awhile and i think i mean here there is that sort of like yknow he who has the most wins or whatever that yknow phrase is and yknow there is that with and whatever but i don know i mean even with the food and everything else i mean it cheap people buy so much of it like portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean there yknow the portions are a lot smaller it more expensive you just eat less and i mean you just see it contributing to everything i mean it the obesity problem here and everything else i mean it getting worse there than it was but i mean it nowhere is it any where near and that is a large part of the like problem with that people were constantly on me about oh why are americans so fat and like all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending girls i ve never seen them take a guy out of a bar um hum i not sure it usually the girls look younger than guys i guess i don know because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so i mean the cops are just looking for people that look younger they don have time to go and look at the stamps on everyone hands and check their i i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger guys will drink at the bar girls usually drink before the bar as is my experience because the girls are afraid and paranoid of getting caught with clipping another with a container at the bar the guys think it macho or whatever to be able to buy beer yeah four nights a week sometimes recently it been like saturdays that about it yeah because there no fear of being caught by the parents there no one to like check up on you in your dorm room i mean you re pretty much in control of your life at this point i don i don really remember october if that yeah i still had a three point two first quarter yeah i i moved into the dorms late september last fall me and my two or two other of my roommates took a trip i went skydiving white water rafting and skydiving again right before we moved in like skydiving wednesday white water rafting thursday and friday skydiving saturday move in sunday um the skydiving up by wooster and then the white water rafting is down in west virginia on the new river yeah and i trying to work on my license for skydiving though um hum i really didn start drinking until probably early or late last summer right before college and then couple times nothing really big i know a lot of my friends did but i didn i don know how you would define it as serious at this point because college is mostly binge drinking i think the real problem comes when you start drinking alone and everyday because i mean when your friends aren around and there no parties to go to you usually don drink i say my ex girlfriend she could drink more than i could and she sit up in their room and drink alone sometimes a little bit her mom a severe alcoholic i still living in the dorms until this wednesday moving home for the summer working taking a summer class i living in an apartment um hum yeah i knew two of them since i was real little then the other one just fit in really well yeah she lives two doors down and um i came back from working on my ceramics one night and she just gotten back from a party and she was talking in the hall with my roommate and we went back to our room and we watched a movie and my roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer um hum just kind of hit it off from there um hum um some kind of computer animation like at a video game at some sort of like movie company like pixar or something like that yeah that want i ve been playing video games since i was two so um just to get in the school there about thirty people applying they let three in um hum to the art and tech department um hum um you have to take a foundation of courses which consists of art one sixty two through art two sixty um then you submit a portfolio in the fall for review and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department um hum they let three people in fall quarter clipping three people in spring quarter um hum this fall the first time i ll be submitting my portfolio definitely i have a five hour course the first term of summer quarter and then i probably gonna be working on my portfolio the second term um my parents are all for it they ve always been supportive of whatever we wanted my dad seems to think i should go on to law because there law in everything you can do anything with a law degree yeah no he doesn have a problem with it at all yeah oh when i was a senior in high school i wish my parents would ve pushed me to do something practical but i glad they didn because it gave me a chance to make my own decision well it would ve been something that they would ve supported and something that i would ve probably been pretty good at and they would ve made it so i wouldn have had to make the decision i mean that was a hard decision to yeah um hum thinking about journalism um design graphic design in particular after i quit wrestling i got really into computers so i pretty much live on my computer i on the computer at least six hours a day not at all you re talking to people all over the country and i mean you re becoming more diversified because you get thoughts and opinions from people from all across the world and and it not just like one group of people and now it our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation that all these things that are still popular it that we don look down on the sixties i mean i th think the sixties sounded like a pretty fun time to live i would get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can do it anymore because we got all these problems um aids being one of them um uh politics i mean we we grew up or came of age after the cold war was over um i very cynical about this i have a fairly leftist uh political uh uh stance which i feel has been complete completely devoiced in america because of the effects of the cold war uh i ve inherited this world where there was of uh uh where am i going with this um i mean the generation before us had like vietnam and protested against it i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before but and when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about yknow and i not being clear so i not exactly sure where i going with this i very cynical of uh about about the world i ve inherited uh cause i see a world in which my political views have been silenced by fifty years of of you know like international politics sort of like propaganda um that says yknow like to be left of a certain point is bad like among conservative circles the word liberal is is like almost like calling someone a communist in in the forties um where as i very cynical about that cause it they feel that it it wasn it it it been a cultural process that has been developed and now i being handed this current situation which i see is completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation is cyn cy cynical and the reason i cynical is because we re handed a world in which we see the injustices of the past or not the i the the hypocrisy i mean i guess injustice also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff but that why i cynical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i don know i feel kinda preachy like this is my position uh the technology um i mean like i like living i in a world where technology puts everything i need at my fingertips um i mean uh i think that something that would not have happened had there not been a uh uh a highly a highly populous generation suddenly that was competing and within itself mean i some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we ve got this super high tech tape recorder not a big reel to reel thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are that are not in our library and then where do i go from there um i like being able to look oh library of congress has it i ll just drive out to washington or have them send it here yknow um that i think is a major contribution of the past generation uh civil rights um well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an illusion um yeah they re on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little on creating an equal and fair society um some my leftist positions will come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where where in the social stratum where you were born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these cla i mean i i don want to say class lines because that has so many like historical connotations cause it not the exact same as say class was in the marx sense but class lines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that gonna buy a house for your family and let them live in a relative comfort i mean i in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual uh civil rights ha only went so far they haven corrected the wrongs of the past they haven uh created uh a a a sense in our society that anyone can achieve like the american dream in in my opinion is an absolute lie and that the the the people who whom most face that lie are the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation um so what i mean civil rights was an a an important step but once that step was made it was stopped and now i believe today there are uh i mean it i see a a growing movement of people who want to who curtail the advances that were made in the sixties and it not our generation who curtailing it it still the uh like our parents generation um right right yeah mm ah it yeah yeah we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progresh progression that needs to be made um i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who a fellow history major her and actually her brother a fellah fellow history major too and a friend of mine i don know him all that well which her family i mean she she double major in history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports her in this but they ve made it painfully clear that when it she shouldn plan on having a career because i she gonna hafta raise children at some point which is uh that not the way things should work in my belief uh and and the fact that it like the males telling the daughter like this is how things need to be i think i mean yknow i think an individual should have the choice but i feel i mean i i i concerned about a a uh like this push to the right that sort of going on hoping it sort of dieing out but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four ninety five but uh i think uh uh we ve reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred percent successful the the opposition is criticizing the advance um and and trying to stop it um uh i trying to think of some good examples i mean when politicians start talking about like biological functions forty nine um hum i ve been here since seventy two actually um hum i actually from athens i was in the service there for about six years so mine was southeastern ohio um hum just kind of moved here a little bit all right a uh uh i got out of the service my parents were uh older and the um kind of felt an obligation to be around them to help take care of them and stuff um hum uh th we actually were from columbus we moved down to athens and then uh they moved back up here when i was in the service airforce um hum mm i was in sixty nine to seventy two so um then i was in two years reserves uh uh basically uh electronic engineering not not an engineer but electronic assembly and stuff like that and this was systems analyst was what it was called but th they ve got these big names for things um hum um hum yeah i graduated from athens high school uh enroled in uh for uh the winter quarter and proceeded to party that out and and at the time we uh the there were had drafts draft notices at the time so i got a draft notice and enlisted um hum uh i kind of uh i i was like a rebel yknow i didn really uh it wasn really my cup of tea actually i had a pretty decent job i worked four and a half days a week uh basically in the uh electro uh mechanical type of things yknow remove and replace what they do a lot now with cars and um they put a thing on a machine and that says take that out yknow and try it yknow and you put that in and so was there it wa it in hindsight yknow it was was cool but but i had i liked the long hair it was uh back in the sixties so yknow um hum yeah i was only nineteen well i was eighteen when i went in but um hum well i ve been i ve been married and uh divorced and uh i got an eighteen year old daughter uh they live in saint louis um i worked at ashland chemical for about thirteen years uh in the administrative management and kind of went through some bad times there and everything so uh kind of i i like calling it working for myself uh because i worked through a temporary agency yknow i work when i want to and do what i want to do and but it gets kind of old too yknow when you like two day a all this week i haven been able to get out yknow so um hum um hum we were married eleven years so um hum we got divorced in eighty eight she doing all right as far as i know she going to saint louis university don ask me why but well i wanted her to go to missouri or uh or come here but she says only reason you want me to come there is because you get football tickets i think well no i wanted to see her obviously but that was a part of the reason but um hum uh not as much as i useta be when i was younger we useta be diehard but not any more yknow hum um yeah by their standards but they still were six and six yknow and they prob probably could ve won maybe a couple more games but that about it yknow really no i i just a player yknow i mean they lost uh four or five different uh top notch players that went to the pros and most of them are starting or yknow so uh old cooper thing is we don rebuild we reload yknow well sometimes it takes couple years to reload yknow but i ve never been an ravid fan of cooper either so they did just says some stupid things sometimes i was listening to uh cor or not corby uh some show on and i listen to them talk shows and everything and uh he supposedly has said something to uh he had got rid of two assistant coaches so he splo supposedly said something to one assistant coach said that yknow i like to hire you and everything but you re not the right color yknow i mean that not something that you would think a head coach at ohio state would say yknow um hum but yknow when he first came here he said that you couldn win here because he had too many slow white guys so and that was pretty dumb but um hum well i i i surprised myself yknow they wouldn say who the guy was that interviewed but i don think that probably be that hard to figure out yknow they re uh um hum um hum yeah they you you love to hate him or love him one the other i a i think he a great coach uh i think he does some stupid things but we all do yknow um hum um hum uh he he uh was a a a great advocate of uh of old woody yknow so he probably learnt quite a bit from the old general yknow um hum yeah um hum well he had a thing i i read a book about him a season on the brink where he he had a bad couple years there and everything yknow and and he bring the guys in yknow and sit there and say now if you want be a pansy there down there where the football team is yknow i want you to be a man yknow play basketball um hum um hum i got a friend of mine that graduated from uh purdue university of indiana or something like that i think that what it was i said university huh um hum yeah and they just beat indiana in basketball saturday i think it was um hum um hum um hum yeah well they had a heck of a time beating cincinnati which they probably should ve killed and then had a heck of a time beating them yknow um hum um hum um hum yeah and that the where you that way you really you should be i mean uh you got to be ready for tournament time yknow i don know if this thing moved or what yeah uh i like baseball i useta like that a lot better when i was younger but now i don i wouldn take the time to sit and watch a whole baseball game on the tv yknow yes right right absolutely oh yes i come back and it the simplest things um hum um hum um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and yknow i think i mean i i i don know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on um not columbine but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it the year before i was there for both of those but yknow in the first one yknow they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear ho holding the gun everywhere and columbine yknow every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and yknow their facts were all over the place but that another kind of issue but um what i think caused it i mean i don know i think that like more should ve been made of the fact of yknow this like terrible sort of resentment for the other students and and yknow i not in any way defending the guys who did it but um yknow something is wrong not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever that yknow that you would even think of doing something like that um i don know especially with yknow everything that was said about the families and yknow they didn seem to of course you never really know but they didn seem to have grown up in this yknow terrible environment and yknow have that sort of yknow preconditioned or anything like that um yeah i think i a lot more effort needs to be made yknow to sort of yknow placate those sort of situations and i mean who does it is sort of another question because yknow the teachers already are over worked and underpaid and yknow all those kind of things but i don know right right right well i do think access is too easy but it sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so yknow just beside themselves that it would i don know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with th the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be yknow doing illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing but i mean too many people have guns here there too much of a in my opinion yknow there too much of a gun culture i mean over there they ve pretty much outlawed guns except for hunting and things and the fact that yknow of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that obviously england such a small country in comparison but i mean that just amazing to me and but it true i mean the fact that yknow the access is just there almost nothing barred and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of yknow in conversation talking about oh yeah i yknow getting a gun for security and all this stuff it like yknow your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of yknow happen chance that you would need it the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who wasn yknow i everything is against you yknow yeah exactly and it just it just ridiculous but so many people don seem to think that way and i do think yeah access it would help if access were restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are in place now aren necessarily followed and yknow that kind of thing but the whole it especially with the first few shootings yknow with the children i mean yknow they shouldn know where the keys are if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that a yknow how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school right oh were they were already in the garage did they not buy them themselves oh right oh right right right right well it sort of a problem as well the yknow does i mean uh it seems yknow from what i ve read it if you wanted to make a bomb it fairly un uncomplicated yknow so that right um at the age that they were i don know i i wouldn personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have yknow a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should ve been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those or at least one of the two had been in counseling and had to yknow was doing it aggression management or something like that um yknow you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of yknow maybe keep a closer eye on what they were doing so i think yknow to that degree yknow the parents should ve um yknow um worse sort of responsible and also with like their kids disposition i mean yknow would you not notice some difference if something like that was going to happen i mean depending on a yknow how well they hid it or whatever but um i think at that point though you re you re so influenced by your peers that like the parental influence isn as much as yknow before then i think by the time that you are past adolescence um hum right i know um well like i said before i think i don know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you re gonna have a lot of people who are yknow people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends that they said i mean yknow they can play off whatever and unless they were yknow kids because they re only little once that what i tell myself when i get really really frustrated they re only little once and they will be grown up before i know it yeah because i mean five years went by like yeah it was yeah because i don have a degree i went back and did a one year um schooling get nursing license i became an so i don have a degree my husband has a degree i put him through school finished his private school wittenberg no eventually yeah we ll see where i at in five years i know everybody is like well don you want to go back for your i like after working with and we were doing the same things basically and they didn get paid much more than i did so i was like well what a waste yknow go to school for nothing basically just to learn a few more theories just a little bit of both i think i looked into some phonics i went to the library checked out some phonic tapes let him watch those cause kids love to watch things and just reading with him and going over things and it it been amazing just to see it like the light bulb comes on and yeah and he can sound out things and he can even spell things just from his own understanding of phonics and yeah i ve i been pretty impressed i like wow you got that really really close to being the right spelling just from what he learned well i mean most of it was me going over it with him and just yknow i talked to some people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and yknow just doing the things that work for him and as an individual i say we do oh at least an hour or more a day something like that well i mean i wouldn se i wouldn say it was an hour at a time but yeah and he loves playing on the computer doing roms and loves watching the magic school bus so i i try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk no well right now i think he knows enough i just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things i pretty i like wow i can even build the stuff that he built he makes ships and cars and rockets an i a i i impressed i like ok i tried to build a car and it didn look yeah so ah probably yeah nah because right now yknow because he knows how he he learned i say he knows more than most kindergarteners so i don even push anything we don really have a set schedule right now and i just letting him be creative and yknow letting him help around the house and yknow just if i let him watch something thats educational based usually and i let him play on the computer we ll go to different websites sometimes to check out things and i amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he he listens to he picks up toys he ll vacuum he puts dishes in a dishwasher and he can um put clothes and take clothes out of a dryer and put clothes away yeah he cleans his he cleans the toilet too because he a boy and boys even some men don quite hit the mark sometimes so especially since most of that is his i would say ninety nine ninety eight percent because it hard being the only girl in the his mom was june cleaver um hum hum um hum um hum um hum um hum and then they end up okay anyway that good right yeah he be lost um hum at the age of ten i shouldn be having to clean quite as much as do now ah mm i say by ten they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themself i know i did at then and to be able to do their laundry maybe definitely help out a lot around the house no thanks you decide what classes were gonna be taught and you could just start from the ground up like you don even have a requirement you don even have to teach english classes if you don want to or you dont have to teach math um hum i don think i can answer that on the spur of the moment i have to think about that i really would i yeah i would i say yknow life application things would definitely need to be part of it i don think that you should throw out english or math or yknow can believe i saying this history but i don think you should throw out that stuff but i don think that there should be as much emphasis on it i think more of the empham emphasis should be on life skills and just being able to make it on you re own and take care of yourself and but definitely i think that those other oh the well they knew all all different things i mean i mean culturally yknow it was different different music it was it was course i i in a suburban high school in cincinnati you didn get exposed to much uh so that wa that was the the biggest thing well and of course they talk funny in the east but um that yknow other than that other than the culture shock um it wasn it wasn that different yeah if i had um if i had stayed for the i i didn graduate so if i stayed for the fourth year um when we did a lot would do a lot of um uh uh making up a portfolio that kind of thing um i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i pro i would ve i probably would ve stayed but it was yeah oh yeah yeah i liked it a lot um but it was it was nineteen seventy and there was kent state and there yknow all that stuff going on and it just school just didn seem that important and also i think i think this happens to a lot of people as they approach senior year and say oh my god yknow i gonna graduate and then i gonna have to be a grownup ok i won graduate which is well yeah yknow could have done that too it i mean i i know i don know en i enough about it to really say but it i can i mean it i don know where they got that i yknow maybe i oblivious to things but i mean i mean seems like there lot of worse places i yknow from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we re only talking about ten cases that not very many yknow tha that i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i yknow i don don live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh yknow i just don i no i not in touch with it with that situation no we re pretty white um hum yeah well i kn know among the people i know i think i yknow we re ex i th i think it a pretty tolerant city um uh i know a lot of people who live down in old town yknow in a very ah diverse environment and um um yknow i just i just don i don personally know any racists i don think i sure i sure it is yknow it just the circles i move in yeah yeah yeah i it surprises me to hea to find that that columbus is is so out of shape um but i in the i well yknow in the circles that i move in um everybody is very middle aged and they all quit smoking and they re all all the sudden trying to beat off the reaper and um uh so yknow i mean i mean well and course they were always hippies and ate sprouts and twigs and leaves anyway yknow so th that yknow that the sort of circles i move in but i know because i ta take have these part time jobs from time to time i see a a whole different group of people and i can say it probably true yeah yeah yeah yeah word yeah so i tha i mean that probably circles i move in is what coloring my whole view of columbus i mean there a lot th there i sure there a lot i don know oh yeah yeah and i th i think i think even even if you re aware of everything that here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it colu it just columbus it just columbus ah maybe it because um people don take advantage of what don realize what actually here um don realize how it i mean yeah it not chicago it not new york it not san there a lot of places it not but it ah yknow it not a backwater either well they need to get out more i yknow all this oh we ll never be a major league city until we have major league sports is a well i yknow i guess um getting out more wouldn help those it um ah that that would be th the yknow that would be such a small part of of civilization anywhere for me and um i pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just i i i really do think people don take advantage of it the way they should i think so i think so yeah yeah a little a little geography wouldn hurt yeah that that one of the drawbacks yeah yeah yeah yeah or the festivals in the summer that they have downtown i mean those are those are really great and they re yknow i mean they re they re crowded but they re peaceful yknow there not there not rioting in the streets and there a lot to do and great yknow great music yeah yeah no i don i i do um okay well i not really from columbus either i ve been here for a little over a year now my husband went to high school here and had a daughter while he was in high school so after he finished college he wanted to relocate here and we kind of live between worthington and westerville kind of north columbus and i like it a lot i i ve always lived in ohio so i a native ohioian southern ohio um hum right now i staying at home with my two boys i have a one year old and a five year old and um my profession is a nurse i a yeah but i ve been taking a little while off since i ve had the baby um hum and um i i ve pretty much have picked up the belief in attachment parenting since i ve had my second child and i ca can it where you believe in breast feeding from birth until whenever and holding yknow like carrying the baby in a sling with you and just being available for the baby needs and just no not really oh i i feel a huge difference for me personally um just in the um closeness and being able to pick up on his cues a lot better and just knowing his needs and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively i think so yeah oh yeah um hum um hum um hum um hum i know um hum that another thing i forgot to mention um hum exactly just from family um hum oh yeah yeah but it was something i ve learned just from the other parents well mostly mothers that i yknow talk to is that yknow if it not necessary to say it then it necessary not to say it so it just kind of a in your home type of thing and you don really go around saying yeah we sleep in the same bed and we breast feed still and you just kind of they ask and you re like yeah well yeah that just the way we re doing it so um hum um hum yeah how appaling oh yeah yeah my my family my mom especially is just like when are you gonna stop doing that yeah because he sixteen months now and i think he tapering off quite a bit so i think that he ll be done soon but i not pushing him so i think so he he not being forced to go in any direction that he not ready for yeah i was going to college and and going to work and i mean i think that their personalities are different too though so he was very independent but i not sure that that just his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put being put and being in daycare from a very very young age and and then yknow my youngest he never been in daycare at all so it just just kind of instincts i yeah actually there are quite a there an an a well pretty well known doctor that has a ton of books and i go to la leche league and that kind of their philosophy in a way yeah just that breast feeding is yknow a way to mother and nurture and feed and yknow it it meets all of these needs it kind of like it just yeah um hum um hum um hum oh i believe it um hum yeah well one of my la leche league leaders she has a and she does a lot of reading and she said that she actually read a study that they did um for breast fed babies to bottle fed babies and they said the difference in their i is equivalent to uh a regular bottle fed baby and a baby exposed to lead poisoning it that much higher even clipping so i mean it just given them that much of uh better head start on development so that fine hum um i don my husband does but i kind of sleep between them when they re but right now i ve cause we ve early on we took our bed down and just kind of had like the mattress and the boxspring on the floor and i ve got like comforters on the side of the bed so cause he like he ll like get out he just like i don wanna be in the bed with these guys and he ll get on the floor and he ll sleep on the comforters on the floor but he close and he happy that um hum um hum right there yeah that yeah um hum i think the mother has more of an instinct for that but as far as the studies go where the people roll over their babies i don see how you can roll over on anything that size and not know it unless you were on drugs or drunk or whatever you know what i mean um hum um hum um hum yeah because i couldn imagine rolling over on th that that one of the things we looked when we were shopping for homes was we were shopping for schools systems just as much yknow so and i don want to buy a house and i don want to have to move when my kids get older to move into a better school system so because it seems like since we ve bought our house the houses are just doubling and tripling in value it unbelieve yeah oh i don know ours is increased quite a lot since we ve been there but we ve been there i guess about ten years um we live rented in grandview before we got this was our first house grandview has it own school system too but yeah oh no that one you stay away from yeah yeah we did a lot of searching when we bought our house yeah it hard to find what you want in a house and get the school system too you get in to arlington you get in to grandview places like this or bexley and the price range we were in you were gonna have to dump fifty thousand in to the houses just to get them up yknow we had a list of what we wanted in a house and our house was only seventeen years old when we bought it but it had everything we wanted fireplace full dry basement yknow two and a half car garage yknow all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older houses wet basements garage burned down or yknow the lots were packed so we live on a golf course and have a creek in the back yard and so it really yeah they don yeah they play in the creek they don play golf yet the ol oldest the daughters are already taking golf lessons yeah so i don know she likes it oh yeah it so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and look in your house the neighbors right behind you you re staring at them sitting on their deck we got all woods and a creek and then the golf course so so that hard to find in the city limits because we re inside two seventy still so yep they put them so close these huge homes and then there ten feet between them and everybody sits in their little backyard with their fence around it and looks at each other yeah yeah yeah i was just there nothing and i was we looked at some of those and my wife like there no way we re buying the yknow you feel like you re in florida or something yeah yeah where the trees were mature and they didn really ruin our development and cut down a lot of the large trees so yeah for columbus um living here all my life i don like it yknow i like the old cow town yknow they can call it what they want i don ge it was easy to get around you never had any traffic you don sit on the freeway like you do now now it like you don wanna go out at four clock or yknow you just don wanna get involved in it so i don know growth is good but i guess i not into as much as they re a lot of other people it good for the economy but it just amazing all the every time you turn around they re plopping two four hundred home unit yknow developments up here and i just thinking where are these people all coming from yknow you do just can imagine where these people all move from this is getting scary yeah what the big draw yknow and you know you still see yknow when they opened up a lone star steak near our house they couldn even do lunch because they didn have the people right so you know that it the people are just dying for people to work out there yeah so yeah i not some of them just look like yknow cracker back box houses that yknow they put up in a week or some it amazing how you can drive by and then in two weeks drive by and there fifty homes because there a lot of growth in hilliard hilliards that starting to scare us actually a little bit because now they just built another whole high school so two whole high schools i think they were up to two or three thousand senior graduates last year yeah yeah that the worst part there are a lot they could really double they took our neighbor is in the sixth grade and they took a whole elementary school last year and turned it into sixth grade just one school so that how many of those there was um i don know i think they re enjoying and i don know yknow but it mindboggling that it because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you re talking two whole high schools two football teams yknow it just mindboggling all these people you know you graduate with you know know of hand full of people and don know anybody else it like yknow a lot more of a tight knit group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it yeah oh yeah yknow people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so it kind of like the small town thing which would have goods and bads but i don know yeah my parents still live there and i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with it still live in town and yknow they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple years ago and a lot of participation in that and so oh i don know just seemed easier yknow life was yknow i don it just wasn the the drivings the main issue with mo most me yknow the freeways we have here weren built for the amount of people that travel on them now i remember when they built seventy one north i remember when they built seventy east yknow there were no freeways yknow and yeah i remember going up three fifteen when they first opened it and it was like no body was on it you could just drive on it and it was like an empty road that no body knew about yet and now it like a parking lot everyday so ya it just a lot of different stuff about it yknow that and i don know it seems like yknow activities to go do things everything more crowded it yknow my wife thinks this city the eat out city yknow everybody if you go anywhere at six thirty everybody and their brother is eating out all the time it seems like constantly we live near a uh we live near mill run which is an area they ve just built up in the last few years that just has like twenty restaurants in it that you drive by any of those at five six clock every lots full to the brim i don care if it tuesday thursday yknow so yeah or yeah or yknow it tough when you know you ve got kids that are doing softball soccer yknow all these events and yknow like on thursdays when the daughter plays softball my wife leaves the house at eight thirty and she usually drives from work to the softball and after that she home by nine so she like i can see how you fall into this drive through window business yknow no but luckily yknow i pick the kids up so that helps a lot i can get them home we can find feed them and i can get them so that how our life is mister mom oh you have to nowadays yknow i don understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that just doesn happen now now yknow if your wife didn work you could expect these things but she doing forty hours a week too so it is it work and it a full time job they start shoot the seven year old just brought here it is the end of the year second grade she brings home this project gonna have to have a book report use three books of reference yknow she never done anything like this it was the battle all weekend long yknow getting this information out of her yknow she had to pick an animal and do a whole report on it she gonna have to stand up in front of the class and make a box with a display in it and i was just like this is second grade this seems more like yknow sixth there seems so much more advanced than when we were kids yknow i can believe in second grade we were already writing cursive already that all she writes in now i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe might be learning some of it yeah she in fractions she doing fractions she doing percentages already in second grade and i thought we were one plus one two you know in second grade it just seems like they re three years ahead so i always wished somebody would redo a survey on that and say yknow back in sixty five or whatever what the difference between what they re teaching them then and what they teach them now is it really that or is it just our imagination just don remember enough yeah it seems more to me and computers really have helped it because yknow the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction and letter games and yknow at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff it not game game it it has a game theme to it but and then it different businesses like white castle pizza one of the pizza places and uh some of the supermarkets and things and they re advertised yknow throughout the community so these kids when they have problems they might wanna go to huckleberry house and they don have a way so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a yknow group of volunteers would go out and pick these kids up take them to huckleberry house which isn far from here so i did that for a while but uh wasn very uh satisfying because i really didn feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids at huckleberry house well they only keep them there like for yknow a day or so and then they um try to intervene with their family put them back with their family or um maybe call in children sevices and i and i just really don think much of children services so yknow i just got out of it um hum no with the system well i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes uh mo uh yknow a lot of the fo yknow there people with good intentions but i just think that it just needs to be restructured totally different way and uh yknow maybe pull these kids uh into more of a group setting or something and give them more um yknow counseling uh professional yknow counseling because it um yknow i i didn have good experiences with foster homes and and i know of a lot of kids yknow they re saying that i think the parents have too many rights yknow in the courts and there just a lot going on yknow that uh it not gonna get better it gonna get worse yknow with the way families are torn apart now and uh yknow mothers have to work and uh you just can yknow stay home and be that uh yknow perfect mom yknow so there just a lot going on uh that needs to be restructured so the runaways uh well i think the youngest that i met was maybe but that yknow still young i picked up one kid he he had been in uh he was only about fifteen he was adopted and he ran away he was having problems with his adopted mother and he was in a an all all night restaurant and he was bragging yknow that he met this man and the man took him home yknow and he slept at the man place and i was telling her do you know how dangerous that yknow that could have been for you and uh he thought it was cool yknow so yknow just things like that he was lucky yeah he was lucky so excuse me well typically what i observed is conflict yknow with mom most of the time uh well i think a lot of times when there a stepfather involved yknow that becomes a problem for some of them but they said yknow you might run into a case where yknow the family abusing uh the child yknow but i didn run into that really yeah um hum yeah go in there and find out yknow is the kid being abused if the kids being abused yknow take him out yknow forget the parents rights yknow or um yeah yknow if they re using drugs put them somewhere yknow and get them yknow get them in rehab yknow keep them there yknow just don throw them there for three days and then throw them out it a lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes where nothing getting accomplished in a way yeah i think that would be good yeah maybe a new name yeah um hum yeah they had those back when i was a teen they wanted to send me to one of those my father wouldn allow it because uh it was integrated um hum the court i had a social worker um hum hum i had a social worker um yknow the whole time they might yknow do things different now though but you re supposed to have a caseworker i moved to louisville kentucky i had one while i was there yeah i have two kids twenty nine and twenty two they re real good um hum well my twenty nine year old she married and uh she has a child and she she expecting another one she a senior here at um she ll be graduating in june and uh she worked yknow really hard and my son he uh he a senior he twenty two he a senior here uh don think he gonna graduate in two thousand because he a new senior he wants to go to law school he does uh real well in school he uh like a honor honor honorary thing yknow but that all um yknow on him he did it yknow no uh uh not at all he always had very definite opinions of how his life should be okay and always uh made choices for himself but as far as motivated uh for school no he was always motivated toward a career yeah he grew up here um hum yeah he went to columbus public schools well yknow i or i catholic and i went to catholic schools and so i tried that with both my kids catholic schools and um for couple years and so he was in uh catholic school a couple years but he got he got expelled because he uh a okay so uh he got expelled from catholic school for behavior problems no that no that one thing that uh yknow i found was really lacking here um for my son uh yes um well i was raised most of my life in ashland it about ten minutes north of mansfield ohio and um i uh we moved there we move there from mansfield so i ve been living in the mansfield ashland area for about uh thirteen years i think my dad uh once he got through with his residency and everything we moved to mansfield and he joined a practice and we ve been living there ever since um mansfield about i say fifty five sixty thousand people and ashland is probably about twenty five to thirty thousand people but um mansfield is sort of fascinating to per capita murder rate in mansfield is higher than anywhere else in in ohio um it just it very industrialized there the there a lot of um a certain community that lives there that normally wouldn live in a smaller city like that there just a lot of there a lot of crime in mansfield um there a steel factory there a the there uh not really there all sorts of there all sorts of reas of um industry in the mansfield area but there a lot of it no actually most of it most of it stayed most of it stayed it be it been there for a while yeah we ve got the mansfield state reformatory where shawshank redemption was where shawshank redemption was recorded yep yep well i don know if that our claim to fame but but we do we do have that in mansfield but um ashland is a little bit more and a little bit more of what mat affects a lo lot more locates more of a it more of a um agricultural county um ashland city is right where i live it yknow i mean we re like five minutes outside of ashland city but ashland city the county seat for ashland county and um mansfield is the county seat for richland county yeah but everybody does everything in mansfield because there nothing to do in ashland but uh the mansfield branch campus for there well growing up in mansfield was um uh yeah it was really boring it was really boring um da my dad was just getting himself settled into the community and and with his job and everything my mom stayed home so she stayed with us for a while um most of my early childhood memories are from where where we lived in mansfield it was uh it was a real it was a real don talk don ask community mean you really didn know your neighbors unless you went over and said hi they never came over so yeah yeah yeah we lived in a suburban area of mansfield sort of like the uh the the white collar area where all the people who were business men were getting themselves established so and then um we switched churches and also my dad opened up he he and his partner opened up another uh branch office in ashland so we moved to the ashland area about about eight years ago almost nine years ago and we moved to ashland to get half way between um dad is my dad not centrally located between the ashland office the ho hospital that in ashland the hospitals that are in mansfield he about he said it about a twenty minute drive from all the places he needs to be um actually yeah we live on an we live on an now we live on an eighty acre farm yeah we ve gotten a nice big house a barn some tractors no animals well we ve got a dog but but um it it a farm in the sense that we ve got a barn we ve got tractors we lease we lease some of the land out to a a farmer who who actually works in plants stuff no not to be on a farm no my dad a doctor i all that all that that what he does he not real interested in farming although his major pastime is going out on his tractor and mowing lawn and then doing other miscellaneous things he really likes his tractors really his tractors but uh and he was raised he was raised in suburbia so the who the tractor thing a whole new thing for him so he yknow he really he really it he from rochester new york yeah my mom from akron yeah um actually uh one of my dad really good friends went to the same church denomination that my mom did and my dad went with his friend at to a summer camp that they had and that where they actually first met and my dad was extremely taken with her and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that where they met no uh huh i i come down here two or three times like yknow just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but um when i moved to the city i mean it it was a real big change because i ve yknow used to living in the country and i move into smack dab in the middle of a downtown area yeah yeah lived in the dorms my freshman year and then i moved into a house with a bunch of guys i met yeah so what was different um one the things that i really enjoyed that was different is the traffic and that really no that really that really became really became uh interesting and different for me when i started working for a courier service winter quarter i took off i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a courier service because i needed some money and i love driving and let me tell you it really really different driving around in the big city compared to out in the country man i mean you re flying down seventy one or seventy through town and you go as fast as everybody else is going and if they re going eighty you re going eighty and if they re going two you re going two yeah i mean my dad i brought him down to columbus few times because my dad and i are real close and um i driving around i was zipping between cars and he like i forgot what it like living in a city because he useta live in chicago but um it that one of the things i really enjoy one of things i don like about living the big city is is like but i ve gotten used to but i uh i don like the fact that every time you look up in the night sky and all you see is this like orange haze you can see stars very well uh the noise i mean there always noise i remember last year living in the dorms every morning at two thirty in the morning there was the trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived and i lived in taylor so it this it it in a shape and then the side of the building all the sound just rolls right up the wall and this trash truck made so much stinking noise it ridiculous every single morning at two thirty yeah i didn i i developed uh i developed the the the ability to sleep through anything which is and that that so one of the fascinating things when i go home dead silence dead silence and that is now where i have a problem sleeping because it because there no noise there no noise i so used to like turning my radio on and drowning out all the background sound that i hafta like have music on in the so in that down here um hum yeah i really like the city i like the night life everything in in ashland mansfield shuts down at nine thirty ten clock and it all starts up at nine thirty ten clock here in columbus and that so cool i love it man i love going out clubbing at like two clock in the morning um red zone red zone we usually they open up a nine or ten clock depending on if they got a special show coming in or not but that the place i really like going um they uh they re open till usually two thirty two clock all depends um i also found something fascinating um i uh came to columbus and yknow raised in this really really really conservative extremely christian religious community of ashland and i came to columbus and i started meeting yknow i started meeting the extremely taboo group of homosexuals and i have found some the most fascinating people on this planet are homosexuals um and they re not nearly the they re not the the the evil people that that everybody back home in our community always said they were yknow it just like these are normal people yknow i may not agree with what they re doing but they re normal people and i ve met some really cool people who are who are homosexuals and that leading where that was going was um we went to axis which is uh one of the home well it one of the gay um uh dance clubs in columbus it um it on high street it down in uh it down in the german vill no it not all the way is it the yeah true yes um no actually my roommate in colorado right now and he going to he he gonna be there he gonna he gonna be there all summer yknow i didn decide i wanted to change it over until i got my scanner um and found out that when i checked the web site for the scanner that they re just simply flat out not making windows two thousand drivers for my scanner so it a um crap i don know i just got it i can even remember what it is um paper port i think it paper port avoid windows

brilliant system it was at it uh in in it initial stage and it just got bowled over because yknow something better came out something better will come out than windows microsoft will eventually go under it just gonna take a while uh yeah oh yeah i don i give it probably about six or seven years before for before somebody comes out with a system that just as good as microsoft linux uh i don know i think linux will be around forever just because it such a stable system that so good and yeah and macintosh will stay around forever just because macintosh is invincible um hum um hum after the big hype of the i mac and it didn do as good as it nearly as good as they thought it was gonna do even if did okay it still around it just didn do as good as i thought it was gonna do dumb morons what

financial laws stuff and like being uh uh a lawyer for somebody who wants to sue the crap out of another corporation no plenty of money in that i don want to be an ambulation ambulance i don want to be an ambulance chaser i just want to be want be somebody who helps screw all the big giants well yeah yeah one giant wants beat the crap out of the other giant um hum impressions of columbus well number one i didn realize that it was as big as it is until i started working for the courier service yknow i ve heard people say and i know it true that columbus is one of the top ten largest cities in the united states and i was like what you re kidding me really i started driving around and i like yeah it is this place is huge this place is absolutely behemoth i mean everything within two seventy it it pretty darn big and um that was really surprising um i love i just love living in a big city uh i it just it just everything is so different than living in the country i mean i miss the big expanses of grass out in the country but i can skate all over the place here in town which i can do at home i mean i can skate on our driveway but it stops abruptly and in stones so it gets real boring i mean going down hill is really fun but going back ups pain in the neck but um uh there a lot more people here i re i like lots of people i ve discovered i like having lots people around meeting all sorts of new and interesting ni unique people and every year there a whole new crowd of freshmen that come in and it it pretty cool yep it enjoyable i like it i don know if i ll stay here i know i wouldn raise a family here but no i mean ashland is the perfect place to raise family yep but that about it and i mean i don even know how any of the ashland has ashland university it one of the it got one of the best theological seminaries in the and it a republican tink thi tink thank republican think tank so aside from the college the town is pretty much agricultural i don know why i don know why anybody would want to live there unless they re raising a family because if they re raising a family it a great place great community it just great all around for raising a family no i want to find a i want to find some place similar to that i want to find some place tsiminal similar that in colorado yeah i love colorado beautiful state it got some good skiing yeah skating skiing that how i did this tore my a two years ago christmas day after christmas it um tendon that it a tendon right uh right in the front of your knee that keeps yeah that it keeps your it keeps it keeps your knee from moving out and doing all sorts of other miscellaneous twisting and turning position that it not really supposed to but i ripped that right in half well what i do and improve columbus well for one this place is dirty with crap it it just so it so dirty i wish they clean it up more um uh when i first started working for the courier service i really really hated one way streets but once you get the hang of it they re a blessing because you re in downtown and all of a sudden ding ding ding ding ding ding ding you see like twelve green lights in a row you re just like you go as fast as you can and try and get through all of them all at the same time now mind you if you re doing that anytime during the day that won happen because you ve got cars all around you but at night it pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the middle of down town um improvements i would just say keep i would just say that man this place is dirty yeah i wish they clean it up more often no it not sprawling out from where i am i don live in the suburbia area so i mean i live i live right in the middle of all the houses that have been there for sixty or seventy years and i smack dab in the middle of all the frats and sororities on campus so i on nah that fine spreads out fine i just think it funny i i love to get a good nice overhead view of columbus because you probably see the house after house after house um yknow like they did right in the right in the um fifties uh i can remember what it called like where every single house is a mirror image of the one right beside it and you get all these streets that are in the exact same pattern all yknow like for like miles and miles and miles but um no i think it cool that they re all spreading out oh yeah one thing they could really do with columbus that i ve noticed are i would say lack of noticed in any other city in the united states why in the world do they hafta work on all the roads all at the same time i don understand they hafta to they re working on three fifteen two seventy seventy seventy one six seventy all at the same time why why i don understand it yeah apparently not not really commitment yknow can just be your roommate has to be a long standing kind of thing yeah yknow and that that worries me more than i eh understand a lot of the objection is because this is just uh this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know i yknow one legal step leads to another legal step and then we ll have gay marriage and all those things but i don think that would be a bad either um hum yeah yeah yeah yeah i heard something about that yeah do it the hard way or the easy well i everybody should have to do it the hard way i mean frankly um i think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it and um i i know i didn think that much about it oh well i not doing anything else why not um and um ah i mea i mean ah i don i it seems kind of silly to legally have two levels i mean either either you gonna go do it the hard way or you not and and no legal sanctions are gonna make any particular difference to the attitude you have going into it right divorced yeah uh three years something like that hard to remember it was a long time oh it was it was easy um yeah yeah yeah we didn go to court uh we just agreed to get divorced he went to see he yknow i didn even see the lawyer he just brought papers for me to sign and yeah there was yknow there was no property um well there was a house i didn want it so that was easy um no children so it was quite easy for us hum boy i don know i thinking yknow of the the divorced people i know who ve had children and involved and um boy it always seems to me by the time they get to that step it already yknow they ve been to counseling they ve already tried a lot of other things and that they re a i don know whether some kind of court ordered thinking about it heavy thinking would uh would make any difference or not i think so i think they should be i think they should be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny that that um hetero couples are yknow with home visits and and economic tests and all these kind of things but um the gay people i know uh the ones that would that would want to be parents i think would make great parents yeah yeah yeah well one would one would hope that there would be enough uh word education on the subject that the kids wouldn think it was that odd um that that you had two dads were adopted by two i mean i mean there lot a lot uh becau i it it it difficult to adopt children i mean and it and it should be and so the children they would likely take would be troubled to begin with yknow mixed race or or handicapped or yknow hard to place older kids yknow uh yeah it would be just one more thing yeah one more thing to deal with on the other hand it beats beats yknow growing up in fifty foster homes or an orphanage or yeah yeah um hum yeah yeah getting them some place stable with people who want them yeah yeah and like i say i don i don believe that homosexuality is taught um i think the kid will grow up and discover girls and be just fine or grow up and discover boys either yeah yeah well i th think it starts with with allowing uh heather has two mommies in the elementary school library it um i we focus on sex so much in our society i think and and part of family li so uh sex is such a small part of family life yknow i mean it uh especially with the elementary school kids i mean it just is is there milk and cookies after school that the key yknow yknow do i feel safe is this a place i can go is there somebody who always takes care of me and and i think left to their own devices ah the younger kids wouldn think anything about it yknow you got two adults in your house it doesn matter what gender they are and i think i think if we could yknow if if we could just keep that going into into middle school where it where it not such it it not weird it just a family um then when you start to talk about homosexuality it would be easier to uh it would be easier for the kids to to see that they re just people yknow yeah yeah yeah um i i see it as a problem and and if i if i if i were african american i would i would not like to see it simply because uh yknow it it it a chi a child not being brought up in his yknow in his tradition but on the other hand i hate to i hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orphanage when he could have a home and um i think ah parents who are willing to ado uh going willing to adopt uh a black child or a mixed race child or an asian child or any ge are gonna are gonna be sensitive to the to cultural things because we re just yknow it just the the way th things are slanted these days i mean diversity is an issue and people who are willing to venture out into uh mixed race adoption would already be way hip she has no she hasn worked since my sister megan was born and megan is twenty so she but the thing is i ve got another i ve got a sister my sister megan is my brother he fifteen and a half and then i have a sister vanessa who twelve so i mean it not like there aren young kids still there i mean and she does stuff like lots of things with school yknow she runs all the school candy sales and she does like lots of a she was a president um she also likes to remodel houses so if there a house that comes up she ll buy it and fix it up and and yknow she makes yknow twenty thousand dollars a year on the side doing that she likes to do it and she figures well yknow that kind of makes up for me not working um hum yeah it true and she likes it she really good at it and drives my my stepdad because she ll always be like hey pete can you come over and put these cabinets in he says i don wanna do anything but um she no she sh she kinda the well she does all the painting and wallpapering and like all that kind of stuff but as far as the carpentry work we have um this one guy that been doing stuff for our house for a long time or she ll make she ll make pete go over and do it not like he has a lot of no um usually clintonville my mom she um she doesn she not a big fan of driving she doesn really drive very much which is good i ve ridden in a car with her one time and and it just she just would prefer not to and that okay with us because she she got a drivers license for i and those types of things but for the most part so she kinda stays like clintonville area which is which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of roses and those of things you can get some that are older that need need a lot of work but that a pretty high demand area so that works out pretty well um hum yeah yeah so that pretty much what she likes to do yeah it is it nice it works out well my mom yeah she i didn think she have it any other way well the thing mean i know when my mom my mom has a friend that adopted a baby um a biracial baby which worked out well he is ji just is the sweetest kid in the whole world and um and my mom friend colin is a teacher and she watched jessie for a good three year during the da i mean oh colin paid her obviously but i mean and she really she really enjoyed that yknow something that she could do at home yknow she wanted to go out and run errands she could take jessie with her yknow and that was ha and that worked out well but i think too like with my school schedule yknow if i just in class maybe yknow three four days a week and then the rest the time in the evening jason will be there so it not like i relying on her every single day a all the time to do that and i really wouldn wanna put my child in daycare that would just be too scary for me really how you do this to um hum right right does it em aw that nice yeah i sure right i think sometimes you there a tradeoff between time and money and you just have to look at it and say which is really more important absolutely um hum i know that they changed it i know that it used to just be one day i guess because of the healthcare something like that i feel like a day and a half certainly would be long enough for me i mean unless there some type of complications i would be perfectly ready to go yknow unle unless there something extra that they could do for me there and then i would expect that if there was a problem that they would make sure tha that they kept me there but i think a day and a half is perfectly reasonable i mean i don i don i don know i ve never done this before i can really say but i mean my feeling is the least amount of i have to be in the hospital the happier i gonna right yeah that true well we wen and they ve got a nice facility i mean they have uh uh uh wv like a labor and delivery room it got like it weird though because when you go they show you they they talk about all this whirlpool bath thing a room with it i don know if you ve heard those commercials or not but there there there only one room that like that and it interesting that they advertise that when you go there though if you get that room that what you get if not you just get the re the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there this huge place and you re gonna get that no matter and this and that but when you actually go and look around it kind of little different it yeah it well basically it like a it about the size of a very small hotel room and then it got a separate bathroom with like a big bathtub and there like they there like oh it aroma therapy which is a little box on the wall about this big that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there enough room where people can come and sit down there like a fold out couch bed for whoever in there with you and then they ve got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it born which i think is kinda nice so i mea looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just wanna have a room to all myself yknow i don wanna go some place where i gonna to like deal with somebody else in so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i go home yeah well i figure there ll be plenty of pe i told my mom i just want green jello you she gonna make me oh i don know it just sounds like it would be something that i would have to have it just necessary oh right oh really to the other side i no that interesting though because i think i think that my whole i mean i always still fuh i still feel like i yknow i just one of the kids hi mom yknow yknow i guess it true and i ve always wondered yknow i turned eighteen and i thought well shouldn i feel like an adult now yknow i was twenty one shouldn i start to feel like this responsible twenty five shouldn i be an adult yknow and i wonder at what point do you really feel like you re you are on that other side or you re one of the grown up people instead of one of the little and maybe maybe that maybe that one i mean yeah i don it well that fair maybe that true too i mean i don feel because you know when you re younger you think oh my god twenty seven that so old you must be yknow and now that you re here you re like guys i i feel fine i don feel little more responsible but other than really um hum um hum huh i have to wait i guess a couple weeks i ll be having to tell um hum um hum right well the thing is in lamaze they show you those ta tapes i sure you guys took those classes they re horrible they take seventeen hours of labor they put it into six minutes and you think oh my i gonna yknow these women are like i just want to die you know and you re why are you showing me thi i said didn want to see that yknow i would much rather just have my own opinion of what it gonna be like yknow and go by what other people said i didn no my husband yeah he uh he from she can wear a bandanna but that it and i yknow i would love to do that with her only on things like that i wouldn be the type that would put a sweater on her on tuesday and a little skirt on her on wednesday but i i would get a kick out of that um she yes um we re both i ve gotten kind of bad uh but my husband a marathon trainer i try to run with her at least two or three times a week because she he too fast for her um but we go to like hoffman farms up in off off of cosgray in hilliard i not sure if it in hilliard but um we ve taken her to the scioto part for the concert on the river we don tend to take her to things like the art festival or the it just too crowded and it not fair to her or the other people uh because she has been known to help herself to bread we were like brain dead after this race and my husband took her and we know better but we were like yknow after you run you re kind of like uh and she jumped up on the table and looked around and took a piece of bread and i like oh my gosh you re so embarrassed i so sorry and the guy like ah nobody else is eating it she might as she a golden retriever yeah she three so she still puppy but she getting there yeah um hum yep yeah yeah yeah she did that yesterday so stomach pump uh yeah we ve kind of broken her of that thank goodness the counter stuff but yeah yeah she been known to do that too yeah yes um hum sure do they uh that nice that good right yeah i ve run into just a few problems at antrum um since i do like to jog even though i very slow most of the people that take their dogs there take them off the leash and let them go in the lake and what not which is you re not supposed to do that but when i jogging with my dog on a leash and all the other dogs come up it irritates me because yknow you re trying to run and your dog trying to greet that dog and the dog tripping you and you re like i ve actually been known to go am i the only one following the rules around here because i trying to run obviously it hard for me to run so oh yes he will be yeah it a week from sunday um hum i would love to do it but even when i was my knee won let me i was marathon training and i only got up to about nine miles and um i have unfortunately about fifty pounds of extra weight on me but even like i said when i was skinnier i have like a bum knee on distance i okay to run the lower but uh no yknow i should i really should i do that with the without even realizing it but i haven just because i ve ran for so many years or jogged excuse me i don run i too slow get the track terminology there yeah yeah that a good idea um hum yeah i have read that i need to try that just for winter even you don slide as much that would be good yeah um hum um hum yeah yeah they re pretty good where i live um well last year when we had that really really high snow um i shoveled and then like an hour later it blew over so was like what the um but our neighborhood has a lot of children so most of the people do shovel their sidewalk um hum um about si yeah did we get her we ve had her for two years yeah we did about six months we went to hawaii and got his brother married and then we came back we knew that would be the last long trip um and we were gonna wait till the spring but we couldn so we went to a rescue service and got her yeah uh um hum um hum yeah oh definitely definitely well i ve never had dog and i ve always wanted one so this is my first i like want a so yeah um hum sure well that and they like tuesday when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there she came in and i di didn i was reading a book and i let her out and i let her back in and i started reading again and i looking around and here mud so it kind of good in a because it kind of well yknow i you live here it not the big of a deal yknow because i know my sister would freak i like and her husband believe it or not uh they re not really i wouldn call them neat freaks but um we tease them because my parents and her live within a couple miles of each other in dublin you have to take off your shoes when you go in which is really it amazing how good their carpet looks just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother um and they won allow dogs so she not allowed to go over there so she always like but it does make a big difference so i guess that what i saying for them it almost be better if they let the dog go over because yknow she gonna bring in mud and and it not gonna be perfect maybe knock something over yknow kind of start with her but you have to go home yknow what i mean to let her out and that kind of like i mean of course a kid you can put in a yard and leave them for hours like i did this morning but exactly defi i it would be nice but no um yeah yeah yeah i think so yeah yeah oh um hum yeah um hum yeah yeah to sit on it she not allowed on the couch but we had caught her last winter on the couch yknow you come home and it warm and hey there a doggy bone up here so we ve even been known to slightly start pulling out yknow let the garage door go down i sneak out of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she on the couch and she like i caught it yeah oh we have fun anybody see that you re gonna have to do something to get to the game play or whatever oh yeah you can get them off it don have one at home because we re worried of they afraid we re gonna get them addicted to the internet or so yknow because the nintendo and those type of things are bad enough they re good baby sitter but you need to limit it um i it i think it depends on the child and i think it depends on the adult as far as the supervision of it yknow we re very strict as far as what games they have no yknow it so wild yknow when we were kids cowboy and indians everybody had guns everybody yknow if you had the best death act you were the best yknow clipping and nowadays oh ho don let him have a yknow don let him play with a yknow even a squirt gun yknow and so you wonder whether it overexaggerated or yknow none of us grew up shooting people or this yknow we don own a fire arm but we played with guns and played cow all these games and so i just wonder whether this is really yknow but society a lot different now yeah yeah and we monitor what they watch television wise we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple days a week try to keep them interested in books and and yeah we got actually we use the grandview library they have a really good library there and a large selection of videos and they have story time things where they read to the kids and get them interested in books and yknow different type of things where you can win things for reading amount of books um hum um hum yeah it great you know and they like it they sing a song they yknow interact with other kids and learn to use the library yknow nowadays yknow people don go to the library as much either on they you get your information off the internet or you buy a books or yknow yeah yknow so i just we ve felt that if we clipping introduce them now that hopefully this will lead on to later in with this way you can monitor their television we let them rent a couple movies here and there but we see what they rent or yknow take out compared to yknow the cartoon network and all these crazy it just cartoons just seem so worthless nowadays but actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ones yknow daffy duck and the road runner and these type of things all it was was kill the fox yknow they have that a so we re just like wow wait well i don know if we wanna want let them watch that either so yeah they clipping and disney and disneys pretty strong i mean yknow you think of disney and you think of kids but you still a lot of the stuff they put out is pretty hardcore for a five year old or so i mean yknow a lot of the dinosaurs and all kinds of stuff it it of violent nature but you gotta if you balance it i think you ll be all right oh yeah absolutely yeah it tough sometimes to read the paper at the yeah yeah like this five year old addicted to the tarzan he likes tarzan movie that was out so yeah he wants to we ve kind of boycotted him the daughter to throw it away never don have to watch that again yeah because they go back in three days now this pokemon now it the pokemon yknow oh and they re both like i heard somebody somewhere say my five year old can name all hundred and fifty pokemon characters but couldn tell ya his phone number and and that true with mine he clipping knows yeah he show a picture one oh that hu man chu or clipping something i don know all the names of them and they collect the cards and it a cartoon i believe it started out yeah and the yep the cards with the characters and they all have different powers the daughter has this thing called a pokedex yknow i like what a pokedex yknow she i want the pokedex so we get this thing it a little computer you open it up you print in the name of the person you want it puts up his picture tells you all the information about him what kind of character is what its powers are what it yknow it like it mind clipping yeah it is that what it is of all the pokemon and i just like i don know where it leads yknow like is it any worse than baseball cards or you know probably not it a fad they re gonna move along and move out of it yknow so yeah that what you better hope oh yeah and you know they re like three fifty for a pack of cards you don even get gum like we used to the baseball cards yknow yeah you get three you know out of five six cards for three fifty yknow and you re like geezy cow and every time you go the store they got them all on the check out lane let get the cards now they ve done the first hundred and fifty they re moving on to series two yknow and never oh they are they re killing on it they really are yep that yep we went to a thing there they were talking about that that you gotta figure out what the bainby baby boomers are moving into and invest into those type of things yknow those are the mass people you gotta find out and figure out what needs they re gonna roll into like when they get older yknow you get into the wheel chair companies or something somewhere it just gonna be massive because you know yeah the crew they ve gone to town oh i not really no i was born in fifty eight so no i was past it my sister is more of a baby boomer than yeah yeah so i forty two yeah yeah i at the end of it all seventy seven yeah that was that hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again you re just like wow wait what were those people thinking um hum yeah um hum yeah yeah and it it wild it just seems like the music hasn gone anywhere because they keep going back to the seventy miha the rolling stones go touring or pink floyd or yknow these are groups from back then where are these people that are supposed to have taken over for these people they re not there yknow and the quality of the music just must not be there i don know my daughters into the brittany spears and the um uh backstreet boys sync all this and now we re starting to get into some of that that starting to get a little interesting too as far as music choices and wanting to listen yeah get them the sony walkman and then you don have to listen to it they didn that when we were kids probably i remember our car had an a radio in it and that was it yknow yeah yeah yeah on an album yknow now the kids are like i want the put the in yeah yeah yep i ve heard that too i just differ it different and yknow i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were this age or is this worse yknow yknow now then you can talk to some other people that are oh you haven seen anything yet wait until they just don even want to be in sight with you and don wait till they yknow i not going on a vacation with you i couldn spend a week there with you so you hope that doesn happen but i ve heard friends say yknow their thirteen year olds just rolled over from one to the other yknow from the best kid in town to yknow i running away i never going to school again so it tough and you wonder what causes it yeah yeah is it the family yknow where where you go wrong yknow somebody needs to figure it out that it that what i worry about the larger school systems too that whats concerns me with hilliard you get such a large variety of people compared to like where i was in this smaller group and you knew everybody and this and that it your parents knew their parent yeah your parents knew their parents their parents knew that yknow now yknow and i walked to my friends house and half her friends if she going over to play they got to drive them almost because they re they re all around so it not the neighborhood thing as much yeah and you can let them run around as much as we did yknow we rode our bikes everywhere we rode to the pool we rode down to the store and now you re scared to let them ride around anywhere because you re afraid they re not gonna come back yknow and so yeah it so many different things um it wasn bad it was yknow i enjoyed a lot oh yeah i watched the first open heart transplant i saw the first liver transplant careless this means i get to hear more of my book and why don people use their time yknow and it free yknow rather they get all tensed up and mad because they left five minutes late and expect everybody to get out of the way because they got to get there yknow um hum um hum uh well my oldest one this is really odd because uh the school she goes to it sort of like uh thrift store chic and a lot of kids there go to thrift stores and buy their clothes and i told her i said yknow we are not in the poor house you re not buying clothes in the thrift store so she basically went through my closet and took everything that was old of mine and wore it and i thought oh my gosh yknow because she just looks like a bum i think and yknow when it was time for like a um a a dance or something she would go out and buy a dress yknow at penny or someplace at the mall yknow and maybe spend like eighty dollars for a dress and the same thing would happen every time she would go and come home i go what did they say yknow about your dress and she goes jalena is that you and i go see you clean up really nice i said yknow you have the best shape you re ever gone have in your life and what do you do you wear these big baggy clothes and these saggy pants i said yknow when you get when you get in your fifties and you ve got a gut and a big ass you could do that why are you doing it now but and then my my my youngest one she likes to dress totally different she sort of like uh little bit of a preppy but she uh does not understand why people want to have like izod on their shirt or yknow a name on their pants and she says i just think that stupid she says you can buy nice clothes without that so she neither one of them pressure me and uh the one thing that was really odd when they ra little is we would go like to toys us and up and down the rows and i see kids it like in yknow and they would walk over and pick something up and go and then put it back down and keep walking and it like yknow i told joyce i says yknow i feel like i an ogre because are they terrified to even ask for this stuff and she goes no she says they don want it she says they just want to see what it like yknow because their favorite toy when they were little is i would go to um um what do you call it lazy boy and get five or six of them killer boxes from the sofas and the chairs and take a knife and cut doors in it and they would play with that for weeks yknow until somebody one of their friends would come over and have a little accident and then we go well we hafta build a new house but yknow they just reading and playing with stuff like that they they enjoyed yknow so right yeah yeah well my oldest my oldest daughter is the biggest cheapskate yknow because i keep asking her when i yknow when i call her on the phone or i mail her every day yknow and she goes i said do you are you out of money and she goes well i have like three dollars but i not going to the bank machine because you re picking me up tuesday and i not paying a two service chee charge service sh uh charge to get money out i ll wait till i get home and i like yknow i can complain uh yeah yeah because if she was they re charging her two bucks down there and i told her i says you need to really not get twenty dollars out at a time because i said you need to get like sixty or eighty because i says you get eighty bucks out you re gonna pay eight dollars for it twenty bucks at a time but if you get eighty bucks out you re gonna get two bucks and she goes but if i have eighty dollars i ll spend it and i says well you have a footlocker with a lock on it put seventy dollars in there and have ten on you and she like oh and i said the reasa i know that because that what dad gotta do i said i can carry money or i ll spend it yknow oh yeah by the oh yeah yeah oh yeah right um hum right yeah yeah yeah right because uh you like uh i i always keep using my oldest daughter uh she can uh get up in the morning and brush her teeth and just barely comb her hair put on a shirt and a pair of pants and go somewhere because she comfortable with herself she doesn hafta be made up she doesn hafta look perfect now my youngest one hasta do that and and the oldest one i look at her as yknow i like myself and if you don like me well then move on maybe somebody else does and that way i gonna be yknow and and the like i said she can clean up and look like a beauty queen but she can also look just like yknow just basically yknow like she was raking leaves ten minutes ago and my other one will not leave the house without looking perfect and i just think that sort of shallow because yknow i look at people who got to yknow they hafta have the face lifts and they got to have the perfect hair and they got to have the perfect clothes it like you re so insecure about the image you present that you ve got to be perfect and by gosh if your hair is out of place you re gonna be out of the loop and yknow if if people were just a little more comfortable with themselves yknow and i ve like i a big one to talk i was like mister insecure for thirty years at least then i finally got the point and i went oh the hell with it yknow it too much work yknow you either like me or don if you don go to somebody else and yknow a lot of people are uh are really worried and yknow i don know if boys so much but i know girls are really worried about what people think of them and how they look and it like um yknow why don you kind of like go past the outside and go inside because yknow um my wife was saying the other day she says uh well i getting wrinkles and i i thinning on top and and i go well obviously you re not looking too close at me because i said yknow mother nature has a way of making your vision get a little worse as time goes by and i honestly feel it so that that tight butt tight skinned ow woman that you married who is not there anymore still kind of looks that way because yknow it yknow yeah right exactly yeah yknow and yknow it like uh i i honestly feel the older you get the more you kind of look at what in there as opposed to yknow gosh that just a four hundred dollar dress and a three hundred dollar hair do and yknow what does that mean yknow it like uh when we re food for maggots my feeling is uh some people they re gonna say gee she had a really big house and some other people are gonna go gosh she did work in this area for free and she volunteered at this and she did this and she did this and this and they re gonna go oh yknow it like yknow what what what do you want at the very end yknow so yeah you can you can have a beer gut and a big ass and it means you re it means you re sloppy and lazy if you do but if a man does it like by god he probably got some power behind him and it like duh he probably just as lazy as anybody else it like yknow i ve yknow i hate to see girls starve themselves to death yknow it like uh yknow there are certain times in your life where you re gonna be fat yknow yknow my my youngest daughter has a problem with that yknow she i don know why she so insecure because she out of the four of us including her sister is like yknow right at the top i mean she has done television commercials she done radio voice overs she been in plays and she was in a highschool play when she was in uh a kindergarten student and actually had speaking part and i sitting there in the audience like in tears because and i i like why am i crying but it like yknow how can she do this and yknow like you see her i saw her in a few tv commercials and i like i tried to do that and if you can picture driving along a highway at night with your bright lights on and a deer doing this that about how good i am in those and she just like yknow and she she not a smart ass yknow she doesn show off but she just so relaxed doing this and it it looks so natural but she doesn see that because yknow yknow uh she always thinks she very uh mediocre uh and i go but janelle i said yknow you ve been in front of television cameras and you do so well i said you get on the radio you do well i said you do well in school you have a ton of friends i said you have a great body i said yknow i said i never compare the two of them but there are sometimes when i hafta i said look at your sister she has the same chest i do i said you definitely are well built there i said you have a nice shape i said when you have a bathing suit on it like i go somebody put a towel on her yknow and i said yknow you just don realize all the physical and and also the character attributes you have i said you have a great personality i said you go in a room of a hundred people with me and your sister and about three days later somebody will go john and jalena who but in ten minutes they ll go where janelle at because they all know you you re just so easy to get along with and everybody likes you and i said you just don realize this gigantic list of character physical and mental traits you have that i can never even come close to having what i saying when i talk to them or my mother very nice human being and a bunch of people i don know mm think my mother was okay with it uh a all the conversations had about since then lead me to believe yes this didn traumatize her i think it was kind of a no brainer for her as well she like ah yeah all your friends and your dad or a large new experience that you don know anything about and me talking to my mother was always a very arduous affair na not in sort of an evil sense necessarily and but just in sort of a a challenging sense consistently yes the there was some sort of inherent communication breakdown my mother is kind of a flake not that i not a flake but we re flaky in different ways yes yes no that rude trying come up with like a narrative that both fun and brief okay so my friend chris and i are upstairs playing on the computer and my sister downstairs watching television it sunday morning and um i am trying to figure out how this game works how this game works and then i said got some information on this game out in the car i gonna go get it chris you keep playing i ll be right back downstairs out the front door see my sister on couch go over to the car get the stuff out of the and look up and there two police coming towards me like ooh police officers ooh scary okay and i it was funny because you see the cops first but in reality the cops are behind other people i actually know but it doesn matter because you always see cops first so the two other people that i actually know are stepmother parents stepmother and father have been split up for i don know a month or two now they ve been married for something like six months now and um my sister and i both wanted to tell her ahead of time that she making a horrible mistake but she wouldn have listened to us so we didn bother telling her um so they re coming up and uh there has been like divorce papers and stuff ah and i knew that police officers are occasionally used to deliver important documents i don personally think that divorce documents are that important but nothing beyond the realm of possibility for people take things way out way too seriously yes yes but there nobody at home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so i just figured something weird going on i didn know what was going on but at the same time it was all divorce related just basically dumb because the divorce wasn going to faze me because the entire marriage was we knew knew from the beginning it was a dumb idea and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable so we re just kind of waiting around going oh they re gonna be divorced in a couple months and sure enough so anyway um i i look at these people and their names are the and so the are coming forward with two police officers behind them and mister is kind of a large gentleman and he way too somber experience and if you have to like be that somber about something as stupid as a divorce i going to give you some sort of shit for it and at the um mrs used to be a principal of mine elementary school uh my stepmother mother used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he like think we should talk was like okay great okay so i was like ho boy you re way too serious for this particular affair okay that sine we knew ahead of time this also coming to an end don worry about it so i at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i don know where that is i never found it never saw it never it it anyway not relevant at all the story but it bugs me every time i tell the story because doesn exist anyway so we come back inside and he like well i ve got some bad news and my sister like why ae like all okay go ahead and he like no i thi i think you should sit down i like all right all right at at this point stopped for moment i just like nobody can think their divorce was so important that i need to sit down to deal with it because obviously i i have the curiosity that something whack is is uh is afoot tso i okay i sit down say your your father killed himself this morning and i said oh and then there like sort of a whited out period there so you don get like decent details on on what occurred i don think anything exciting occurred i think mostly it me and my sister on my lap and me smelling my sister wet stinky hair because it smelled of cigarette smoke for some reason so wet stinky hair wet because i was crying into it and then more time passes so some in indeterminate length of time later um i i look over at the police officer who standing on one side and the cops are there basically to make sure i don freak out and that finally sunk in i was like the cops are here so you don freak and like oh i not really in any danger of freaking out am i then you re and was like what would freaking out look like you would never know that why the cops are here oh i was like okay so i looked there a cop i said i have a friend upstairs and i wasn able to put on anything more than that and it didn come out near that well but managed get that much information out so the other cop goes upstairs and chris chris interpretation of the story at this point is one moment i cheerfully playing on the computer and the next moment i i turn around there a large police ih of your room he said hi he said i think you should come downstairs they don tell chris anything so chris comes downstairs and he beside me and the cops on the side of chris and and now chris is just near me trying to be near me has no idea what the hell is going on and i this this sinks into and i was like you don did they tell any you he said i have no idea what going on oh and i couldn anything about i couldn tell him i couldn communicate i was totally yeah well the it was just communication wasn there yeah well there wasn even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it it just there was nothing there there was no ability to communicate there was a he needs to know this piece of information at the same there no way i could tell it to him so yeah is like so so i yeah you don know and there nothing else to do about it and continue on merrily and he i he said eventually he said it was some time later when i actually found out going on i said i had some suspicions because you can do a quick party count and figure out who not there and assume something bad has happened but um but he said but it was a while before i found out actually so so we can stop we can stop the story here or we can go on because this story it it a fun story but okay um chris and i spent the rest of the evening calling people uh i got it in my head that i didn want anybody to call and to say how your dad doing and so the best way to deal with that situation was to call cross the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as as they go cause how often do you get to tell your dad just killed himself this morning so how you doing no i haven talked to you in a little while is everything going okay actually no my my father killed himself this morning you re kidding so you you end up after a dozen or so people narrowing it down you ve got you re kidding you re not serious oh my god and then you can hash mark them if you want we didn but you could and we had two people who who um said you re kidding and then said never mind i sorry pretend i never even said that i was like wow somebody must ve done this before because everybody is just like there no other response but thi there so there there no faulting i mean these folks but still there nothing else do and there nothing creative in response to say to this experience so you end up with you re kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you re kidding and then immediately following it ya you never mind pretend i never that oh yeah yeah he was he was giving me phone numbers for at least two or three hours we had uh several phone books and um like a church calling list and some other nauseous stuff we had just bunches of numbers and so he just fed me names and numbers and i it not ten after okay and um so let see at the end of that um there was a lot of supporting uh erin and then there was some calling of like family people younger and um so there was supporting of erin and then there was calling of girlfriend but you can do the calling of girlfriend until you ve arranged for ride because girlfriend lives two and a half hours away and so if you call the girlfriend and tell the girlfriend that that your father just killed himself she freaks out because she hh no way to get there so you have to arrange for ride first ended up having a guy who lives in logan drive up to bowling green to get her and then drive back down uh bring her back and he said is there anything i can do i i gonna come up there i said sure drive by continue on to he like okay fine no problem i said then i then i could call and say he will be there three hours there be a nice silver seven at location get in and so she spent the next two and a half hours canceling classes and stuff oh he he polite i ll give him that much well i defended my stepmother uh against the rest of my family immediately following my father death because there was ah some bitterness between the rest of my family and my stepmother so my sister and i defended my stepmother against the rest of my family stepmother eventually shafted us and so stepmother is evil they re fun just saying stepmother makes me go hope your father doesn drink oh well that unfortunate okay help i do i am against religion in school i just don think they should push that on people um you know i mean i don think they should make people pray if they don want to before class or anything yknow like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what out there and yknow most kids know what the wrong thing is but um i think i think through education that it just gonna only help kids because a lot times maybe they don get that at home so they re really looking to choose the right thing to do and through school and clipping through education that their avenue to go there yknow so unfortunately yknow and i guess i never thought of it a lot more pressure is put on schools and education now yknow and these schools that have a thousand people i just can imagine i mean yknow my my high school was like four hundred people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a thousand pee excuse me people and just to try to monitor different things i mean it gotta be so hard you know in checking everything and yknow i just think it sad even here in columbus yknow like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools and i thought yknow i just yknow it just could because of all the things you ve seen in the world in the last few year that these kids want to do this just to see what gonna happen yknow it it just sad in our society that that what it turning to i went to brook haven which is uh up on karl road near northland mall yep yes i do um hum um hum well honestly growing up we didn have we it wasn really called sex ed um they talked about the female reproductive system nothing about men which is kind of funny yknow it was always the women and that chart yknow and those tubes and all that i mean i remember seeing that like in eighth grade and looking that thinking that me yknow um but with kids and they re just so much more active at a early age yknow and i hear about kids twelve th thirteen luckily i wasn that early but um i think once they start yknow like sixth grade they really should relate to them um i think that too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but yknow with aids and that as rampant it is is now and there are so many more women that have it um started off it was mostly men um women have got to know as ah at an early age yknow about these different diseases and things and i think that um the morals being yknow especially at a young age yknow abstinence is the best policy so many people i i think they are turning to they re not gonna have any thing do anything before they re married um but in today life once you get in to college and stuff it a little hard to but i think a lot more kids are going that route um because my parents never talked to me about sex we all learned it from our friends um my mother was very open but i think in today world because really there wasn there wasn that many diseases i mean yknow there was but you just didn hear about it and the pregnancies and all the unwanted children and everything like that um i just heard this week that in france they have uh that morning after pill and you know i just really think they need to make that and not uh an option for a young girl i really do because there just yknow there just too many unwanted children there just is and that really bothers me that we don have another option like another country um we re a lot more right wing here in america but i just feel that got to be an option yknow for these young girls it just really does right right well but i think it should be an option you know i really you know for women right and everything because i was single for so long and i just feel if a man could have a child it would be different but since women are the only ones that can then it ultimate ultimately should be our choice i really do and i think you know we should have every option available especially when you re young no girl should have to go through you know pregnancy and everything even if it a mistake or whatever i just you know it ruins their lives when they don have the option right well i think at that age the parents should be involved and hopefully they ll be open minded enough to know that this is going to be something she going to have the rest of her life um i ll tell you what with today world and some of these fourteen year olds that look like they re twenty and you know they they know what they re doing and no they shouldn keep repeating that um i just think the most important thing is is for them to be able to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved i say to the age seventeen maybe you know i think they should have a parent consent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a mistake it going to be if she gonna be young mother and then eventually maybe not even want to be a mother yknow i mean there a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them yknow and there so much that for a while there that was going on and it like you i can believe these women are doing this yknow they just snap well i ll be honest i have a lot of homosexual friends and being in the restaurant business and growing up in the restaurant business and that how i really kind of met them when i was going to school i didn know any and i went to and honestly down there i didn know i didn know anybody was gay um i feel that a lot of people were i ll say most of them or all of them are born that way some of them do make a choice um but i feel that it should be talked about in school um for so long it was in the closet yknow they didn talk about it and these kids yknow had to hide it and i just think in today world and there so many people that are openly gay that it should be talked about more in school i do i think yknow especially i just think some and women there women that you know i had my gym teacher brook haven now that i look at it i didn know then but she was gay i mean we didn i didn think that then i don know why but she was very manly but she was very she was very good but she was you know just not feminine at all and not that that changed my opinion of her um but back then and nobody would talk about it and yknow i just think in today world we need to bring subjects like that out no one because there so many people who are ashamed about things and they shouldn be ashamed because it a lifestyle anymore yknow i just it needs to be brought up more yeah well um hum well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that yknow you shouldn sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is love then yknow you shouldn do it um i know that a lot easier said than done because you fall in love every other week sometimes when you re young um but i don think it encourages it i just think in you know they show so much on it all yknow people are nude on at ten clock at night on these shows and these girls are watching it i mean granted most of them are adults but on the soap operas and stuff it a different story so they re seeing it anyways um you just i think if you re open enough with your children these parents and say you know we we want to give you this option we really prefer you don do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected i mean i think that the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i gay i don know if i gay or what well hopefully they ll know their true identity eventually i mean yes some people so when we got married we had to we were we were together a year we were engaged a year and we knew we soon as he finished school we were getting um within three months we got married bought a house was pregnant with megan and it just like been so for him too uh this has been yknow uh uh a real road because by the time he was twenty eight he had four kids and yknow and and yet yknow we managed to to work through all that together and be with these kids and have this this kind of time we have now he looking forward to he thrilled about the dau the baby that my daughter gonna have but um i would have had a whole lot more kids yknow i would have just kept having them and he said oh four plenty yknow he needed a break so now i be taking in foster ki i too i raised a little boy from the time he was born till he was six well he was my friend she a single woman and she wanted to a but she said she wouldn adopt if she wou would he was gonna have to a child would have to go to day care and this was when my daughter was started kindergarten and i said if you get a baby i ll take care of him til he starts school and that what we did and so he just like my own too now i go and volunteer at he in kindergarten i go and volunteer in his classroom too so it kind of like i hope i get to do this forever oh i think it i would do it in a minute but my family doesn want it they all my husband thinks we re fine he doesn want anymore around and all my kids are so used to all their own uh they say oh no we don want or i say let get a foreign exchange student this would be fun they say no mom we don wanna do that because they don wanna have to be responsible for them at school and wherever so i don know but if everybody ever gone i gonna i ll i ll find some i sure i i gonna keep doing the same stuff yknow i ll find some other kid somewhere else and i ll have some time yknow my husband and i ll have time together and i i always find some i always have a project yknow it like i always saying well when things slow down around here i gonna like right now i should be home counting money for the i i did a fundraiser for the the school we raised um we just sell uh morley candy and wrapping paper and all that kind of stuff and our sales are anywhere from twenty five thousand to forty thousand dollars and so we get half of that for the profit and i do that sale myself but that also means that i have thousands and thousands of dollars to sort through and reconcile so but anyhow i always saying when it slows down but then i always will find another project so and i rehab houses whenever i get a chance i like to do that so the there there yeah no it like you buy it and then you get to do the shopping the fun part you go out pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that and then you have somebody else do that but i don do like major gutting or anything i just like to get something that needs that that that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so that the kind stuff and i ve only done three or four of them but it fun because i ve always liked to fix up hou my own house yeah you can yeah it fun uh huh uh huh right right um hum yeah um hum too much yeah that what you want yep yep oh yeah um hum isn that fun oh i know it so much fun yeah yeah i just like doing it and i have a good set i my best friend is a realtor uh she since retired but it so funny because she would always go through these statistics and this and that because it the stuff i ve done is in and and because i live in area and so she would say oh i don know and she say well how much do you have to get it for and how much should and i would say oh i don know i think if i get it for under a hundred and five i probably can sell it for a hundred and forty if i do this this this and this now you re gonna put a lot of money into that though it not like you re you re still only gonna make maybe ten thousand dollars profit but um and she would say well i don know and for a long time she was always real skeptical because i would just like make up these numbers or just have this idea and finally she says oh well rachel i don know it always works out for you you always get that so just do it and it just some intuition kind of thing but it fun uh huh me too years ago i know that i know i it so funny that what my daughters i do we re goi going then we re always looking and saying hmm there could do this this this this yeah and plus it is and plus the thing is too like when we bought our house we had looked for months and months and months and i wanted an old house it was built like nineteen seventeen i wanted an old house that hadn been kept up yeah the same thing you were talking about and uh we re only the third people to live in it and so it needed everything yknow and it had gold carp now gold back but in those days everything was like gold and yknow and green it was horrible and uh it was great fun we had we had lot fun we we took the back porch and made it part of the kitchen and had another back porch put on uh finished the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put an in ground pool and so i always joke because what i paid for it i now owe three times that amount on it but it because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage so it just that kind of thing if you have specific questions we re never get to them ok it to it only took um the last one i did was on richards road which is right across from whetstone park and it only took um less than two months yeah and i had sold within si six well i waited i knew that what had to have happen on the outside which is really only some paint uh minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and cleaning up the front yard and then we have there a guy who works for me who um i just don know how he can a afford how he makes a living because he very very reasonable he also very loyal to me he done stuff for me for years and uh and he not that old he probably he twenty eight or twenty nine now but anyhow pat went in we added a bathroom there was a mud room we added a half bath off the kitchen and we put in the uh changed the back door and put in the deck and he did those kinds of things and yknow and then we were ready to go and i said i was gonna sell it myself and everybody said i was crazy and i had an open house and i sold it that day i had thirty i had like thirty some people in i got my offer that afternoon i got what i wanted well i didn get immediately the realtors told me i should ask a hundred thirty four and i asked a hundred forty six instead because i really felt i kn knew i knew that this was nice house and i knew it had beautiful hardwood floors built in bookcases and i just knew that that i could ve seen me wanting that house and do you know what i mean it like that identity thing and so somebody came through and they uh with a realtor and they made me this offer that was real low it was like a hundred and thirty eight and the the realtor it i thinking about it because was funny he delivered the offer to my home and i was gracious and i thanked him and i got inside and i opened up and i saw it and i went running out a porch i say wait a minute this is never gonna work i said this will never work i not interested take it back and he said no no no just let just work with us just work with us we ll we ll take care of this so i ended up selling to him for hundred and forty four but it was just funny because i thought he i thought they re never gonna get to where i have to be and we re not even gonna play this game back and forth so and it was fun and i i made uh we made about nine thousand on it by the time we were done um hum right right um i i um i do all of our own taxes i really i keep thinking i must be doing it wrong because it not that hard everybody acts like oh this is such a big deal you just get the booklets you call you ask the questions yeah and you read it yeah yeah exactly i know really yeah exactly excuse me all you do is you just keep your records of um yknow what you spend on things and then there a form you fill out and how much you have if you ve taken any depreciation yknow you need to basically put that back in and deduct your costs and then there the percentage that goes on your schedule that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it just taxed it just not it really not that hard it i i don know how to tell you that um i mean it it got bears uh okay um hum that because it kind of like warm and tropical that why they like it down there especially why yknow we try at si at five in the morning oh the white ones okay oh yeah the the like pigeons okay but they don have any like endangered they re not like on an endangered species list where you can

okay that why they do a lot a lot of like biological studies is barrier okay i ve heard of it is is that why people go snorkeling oh really ch on tv and in the movies that that is what making the these kids think they they can do it i just really think i think it too late i do i personally i think it too late because they can get things on the internet yknow there just so many things so many avenues for them to find violence and pornography and yknow things that we yknow when i was growing up we just there was no way i could see any of that stuff i had good parents but i i was in to yknow lassie and tom and jerry i mean yknow these but yknow they weren violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but i just think i don think it could turn back right now i don know there just too much diversity in the world and too much prejudice there really is still and it sad but it there really is yep i do i really do i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of thems from their parents but um it amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they don realize yknow their old guns that they confiscate and they don realize where they re going i mean that amazes me um but there always gonna be the underworld and different ways that kids and people can get guns and it sad i don know how we could ever limit that but there so many millions of guns in the world that yknow you re wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that um not just a safety lock but yknow you it like identification thing yknow only the only er can do it i mean seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that the people who have guns and in their home and not have them locked up or in a yknow in a place that no child could find it they re to blame they are they re to blame um that whole thing with the um school out in colorado um i forget the name of it but yeah but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents didn were clueless i just find that really hard to believe if a child goes in to a garage every night and you hear clanging and and they re buying gun metal and yknow then they were totally um not in tune with what their kids were doing it one thing them having a site on the internet it another thing that they re in their own in the house where the parents are every night and not going in to the garage and finding things i just can believe and they said they didn even know what was going on it is um i do because they weren yknow they weren in their children lives enough you know they weren talking about things being open about things at dinner yknow finding out about school um i ih can you can blame them for having a site on the internet not too many parents would know that that they their kids yknow um but no i think i i i put the blame on the parents i do i think they yknow if you re open with your kids nowadays you have to be with everything that in the world mean my parents never talked to me about drugs or anything and it was just when the drug culture was just yknow starting we learned about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but today with teenagers and everything so out in the open you have to talk to them about things and just say you know i want to help you and i yknow be there for them a hundred percent obviously those parents were to busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing so i think they re the ones to be to blame i do yeah not that they could have stopped it but they they should have known what was going on uh i really think if they were close with their children they would have known something was wrong especially with these kids here are so removed and don talk to their parents and start dressing certain ways you know that they re yknow going a turning a different yknow i just i blame them though um hum but they lived in a beautiful home i mean if you re to i mean kids like that i could see if they re in a poor in harlem or whatever but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful home in colorado i mean yknow i just think they were removed from what their children or their son was doing totally yeah i don think that though yknow women need to work and most families do need two incomes um and plus when kids go into high school you know you have pardon me you have to worry about them but yknow you you have to let them experience some of life on their own that a big growing period yknow from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends whose parent mothers weren there and they had to clean and they had to start dinner and they hated it yknow i mean and they feel that they kind of missed out on things um but i think yknow kids lot of them who have when they parents have money and um both parents worked i not sure if the columbine if both parents worked but i don think just the mother being home there would have totally helped no um hum um hum well i don think they should be responsible i think um kids go to school and they need role models good teachers um and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late eighties early nineties yknow the schools a lot of them were really bad um i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they can do everything and yknow they just need really positive things when they do go to school and yknow i think teachers are a big part of it i really do yknow you remember when you have a good teacher and that you ve learned a lot um and i think yknow through education because it hard all these schools in so many rural areas and everything try to get good teachers and then yknow it always have to do with money and them not making enough money which the teachers don make enough money and they re overworked and all these big large classrooms and it just seems to me when kids start dressing and getting in a clique together yknow would be hard for them to intervene and say oh what going on in your life what your what the problem you know that that not really should be their role but um if they care enough they should call the parents and say look we re worried about your son he misses lot of school or he starting to dress really ynkow i sometimes and it shouldn be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just yknow turning against the norm of the society yknow and if they don want to be in sports that fine there are so many different things they can do in in school and learn about arts and music and yknow but um unfortunately a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up the slack of what the parents can do but in some ways it always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home yknow i mean well right right i think it would help i do i am against religion in school i just don think they should push that on people um yknow i mean i don think they should make people pray if they don want to before class or anything yknow like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what out there and yknow most kids know what the wrong thing is but um i think i think through education that it just gonna only help kids because a lot times maybe they don get that at home so they re really looking to choose the right thing to do like you hang out like i don know it more of like a sub like a suburban town as opposed to like a centralized downtown yeah it just like yknow like a half an hour or uh or i mean in twe twenty minutes outside yknow you can get to dublin or fifteen minutes to dublin or something like that yknow i mean that still like a part of of columbus as opposed to yeah yeah not really i mean i go to like i go to this club axis sometimes i mean that short north whatever like it okay um like i don know i mean the red zone downtown or whatever i don go to that i really don like that place but um i don know uh kind of the winter months really kill like doing anything like really any like foot traffic type things i mean in the summer it seems like it seems in the winter it seems there more uh that like you have to do something like it more of uh uh this big precession to do anything yknow you have to put on like all of these coats where more in the summer you can just walk in and out of your house and like go go to the park and sit and it fine but like here yknow you get slush everywhere and you got to think of so something to do you just can like drive around and waste time because it because it miserable yeah yeah i i did telemarketing for a while but that that that terrible people yeah i got tired of people yelling at me and like you interrupted my dinner and blah blah blah and like but it was okay because the place i worked at didn monitor our calls so you just yell at them and you just be like i don care like i glad i interrupted your dinner fine whatever like some people would be really nice um and other people would just be unbelievably rude it so funny um but now i do this this uh work at this place called i work there with works there too so i mean worked at the telemarketing place too with me so it makes it bearable uh like it just because i worked there for a while before she did and it was just it was really annoying like um but both places it cubicles yknow and that really weird too um cubicles are odd how that develops i don know yeah and like a keyboard and like this phone you put on a headset and and okay i mean people call in and um it like a mail order catalog thing and um so i don know people are really really incompetent it really funny like because some people um i don know how they have like even some people who can speak english even well enough i don know how they got signed up or how they even have a credit card to order i mean and too you can tell especially when because people call from all over it really funny to talk to people from alabama or south carolina like i never knew people from south carolina had such thick accents like i never really thought of north carolina and south carolina being really southern even though i mean they seceded first yknow i i mean eht eh that i just assu just that different i always thought that more being east coast as opposed to so southern and man there people there who i can even understand what they re saying and like i don know especially too how all like you have to give numbers and all the numbers and stuff and type it in real fast people go unbelievably fast when they say like a ten string number and then they get mad at you when like you can type it in fast enough like if they just said it slow once it would save time and um just how to how how three eight a and a bunch of numbers all sound the same like three eight a all sound the same and um and people yknow you re like a as in apple and they re like apple what what you talking about something like that you re like for real weird and um just how they re like where my membership number and they can find it all right all right look on the catalog where it says number that would be your membership number and people are like oh all right all right but i don know like i i really don i really wanna get a job that like in a warehouse or something so i real easy where i can just like load boxes or something because like i never have time to really i mean like i try and do do like kind of try and do yoga but it like fussy we work two thirty to eleven so it like by the time you get home it like just want to sit and like not do anything and like um yknow working out is hard and stuff because you don have time so i want to have a job where if i don have time at the end of the day to work out it like i working out sort of like as during my job and like i really hate talking on the phone now like having jobs for a while where i talk on the phone makes me just not want to talk on the phone at all at home or too like when i on the phone at home like then it like brings weird flashbacks to work so it like i ll start like talking like i at work yknow so it like like i don know pick up the phone like yeah it is weird like i don know this microphone a little bit different so it not that bad because a lot of times it just busy for a while and then it like not busy at later at night um so and i can just talk because we sit right next to each other so that okay that good that real good well it this it like corporation like i don know it just this like kind of this generic catalog thing i don i don know like it like shopper advantage it has some internet thing with it too um but not really yeah there like people call in and talk about other like they saw it in this other mail order catalog that i ve never heard of either it i don know how really they do it like it just like they get people names and stuff from credit card companies and then mail them out things and people call back or whatever like it everything pretty i mean like basic stuff that you it would be at like yknow like a lazarus or something like that yknow or a bunch different places yknow like electronics uh appliances uh uh yeah i don know like stereos tvs uh washers dryers uh like weird things too like as seen on tv things yknow like people too like when people order a bunch of crap i just want to tell them i like no don do that like don waste like thirty dollars on like commemorative coins or something or like i don even know what their doing or too like when it really apparent that people shouldn be charging this on their credit card when it like you put in one credit card and it doesn go through because it maxed i just want tell them like no don do that like but you can do that or or you get in trouble or whatever and it just funny how yeah like it real weird at uh at our office that um um the first place i ve ever went to where like you clock in yknow that kind of odd kind of like think of a factory like a like a punch card or something but um and just how uh like there this whole thing yeah can wear hats and uh in the building and this whole thing about trying to have a professional attitude and stuff and it just real funny to hear hear people speak like that and really believe it like it like we re taking catalog orders over the phone it not a really a big deal like they re not seeing how we re dressed at all i mean they tell us we re suppose to wear collared shirts and stuff but nobody does like they don really enforce it and they too they yell at like and i if like for hugging or whatever like they told us that one day that we couldn hug they were like no it like you can hug in here or something like that they were like i it away from the professional attitude it like i don even know what to say to people like that like it just like such a different like ideology on it on everything it just like yeah you have you follow the script it that that real funny too like you know i you get um they they listen to you like they monitor the calls and um you know they listen to you and then it like this sheet like if you asked for the specials and like if you you know said it in this way and like if you used this or whatever you know and like um um oh it just real weird yeah yeah like um you have to say at the end of the call you re supposed to tell them um you know don forget to try your member benefits on line at dot com and like i ll i ll like i sometimes i ll say it real you know like kinda like the movie phone voice so i ll be like dot com people are just like like uh i don know sometimes like it sometimes um it yeah it like mess around with people like um sometimes like uh if i don feel like taking the calls or whatever like i ll uh like i won listen to what the people are saying i ll be like yep yep like no we don a have we don have that or something like i do that every once in a while just like when i get bored but most of the time like i try and uh like most of the time it pretty easy like it pretty straightforward sometimes it really aggravating when it like right yeah and it uh and it not too bad because i had to scratch off your ticket you gave me those things are hard as hell to scratch took took my key and yeah they won bother it oh i kind of mad at my team at the moment green bay packers and you probably know that they re well they re four and think they re four and five right now oh my gosh alright yeah they went and won the super bowl and they went back and lost the super bowl so yeah i ve been a fan yknow forever pretty much i didn really have any other teams just watched it and uh yknow they lost yesterday the cowboys yeah so where were you out of uh overseas oh man that is couple miles by time you get there you re all lagged out and hum man i like to go out there overseas somewhere i haven even been anywhere except for canada and uh um niagara falls i was about three years old yeah that when my dad died and while we was up there no less so yeah being three i didn really know anything heart attack ate too much of that good stuff yeah we was going up there to can really remember yknow it been twenty years ago and i just yknow i don have any real recollection of the times and memories and stuff yeah yeah i have a brother and two sisters yeah kind of balance the brother out a little bit youngest yeah so i get a lot of you know what from my sisters yeah my brother well he the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i really care about two sisters and their husbands yeah no oh man that was well i was trying to avoid that no but uh i thought yknow just get a little insight on what going on out there in delaware and yknow maybe possibly find someone to be with but not right now i kind of job motivated trying to get that job that would just yknow send me into the new millennium or whatever you want to call yeah my one sister my older sister she uh got one son he no she she still lives down here my other sister has two niece and my nephew yeah and got more people to buy presents for though yeah well i i think with them they just need to get their heads out of the ground and yknow look all over the place for different plays you look on the screen it different you say well i would ve done this and this and this but yknow down on the field they hafta think that they re gonna be doing this yknow it really doesn look like i mean they re trying it just doesn seem like they re thinking ahead yeah avoiding mi mistakes is pretty much what they need to do better decisions would help well the coach he pretty much got it all together yknow he just needs to put everybody in their own separate category instead of having one person for one part of the team and then another person for another part of the team and no i i not really up on the coaching thing i mean anybody can coach a game it takes players to play the game well quarterbacks got a injury to his hand i mean he still does good he just he needs to focus in on who he throwing at instead of throwing it fifty miles down the road he done that a couple times yesterday and uh watching out who he throwing to yknow might help to yeah i i like uh football and pool yeah i like to go up there and play pool once in a while pretty much anywhere in delaware that i can find no well one place is here one place is right across street from it so i got two to choose just a road over from me i rusty got a pool if you ve got a pool table over down the hall i ll show you it kind of yeah no we useta do uh fifty cents yknow a game yknow just to win back the quarters and plop them in yknow not too much gambling on that part yeah play the lottery once in a while if i have couple bucks on me and uh well football games we won even start with that i uh i make side little side bets not necessarily money yknow just ha ha for fun sometimes i did get money for it though wasn too bad i mean yknow it not like some kind of racketeering deal the feds have me tapped now i busted oh yeah bug the room yeah they get my loan shark in trouble yeah it hasn it hasn gone far as ler far lar loan sharking but yknow the the thing of it is it fun when you win and it still fun when you lose i mean yknow just about and everything that stuff been going on for years so um hum well i think it more capable of being violent because of the uh information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or before you know if somebody got mad at somebody you know you might they might shoot them or something but not a hundred innocent people for no reason um hum no i i personally don because uh yknow i ve seen maybe not to the degree of the violence but mean i still knew it was violent uh stuff when i was kid you know that didn make me a violent person so i think that a cop out myself um hum um hum um hum um hum i wish i knew the answer uh but the reality you know uh i just feel sorry for the the people that not only feel that they have to do that but and also for the people that are involved in it on the other those victims and everything and their parents and everything the only one i really had a i was really upset with uh was the columbine deal and that was because uh the one kid was making bombs and stuff like that in the basement and the parents nothing about or or they did they didn even think anything about and i don think that behavior it uh appropriate for a sixteen seventeen year old kid um yeah um hum and but you know that there and goes back to uh you know the quality or the quantity i mean if obviously this poor kid you know apparently was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs in basement to yknow to figure out some way of uh reaching his nirvana or whatever you know and uh then his parents didn have a clue or if they did they didn care you know um hum um hum hum um um hum hum um mah yknow well nowadays i grew up my dad hunted and everything you know so we had always had uh guns in the house and everything you know but uh you know i wouldn no more go near one unless he was around because i uh i was told not to you know uh and they they always used to say you know if you if you stop letting uh normal people get a gun and the criminals will always have a gun well obviously that not true you know uh my personal belief is that we have the right to bear arms uh if you re of a legal age and everything i not really sure the background checks really do that great of a job um hum how they going to how are they going to judge how they going to uh make sure the lock is on a gun i mean that just seems like a waste of money to me all you re doing is get letting a a company sell a a trigger lock for a gun or and make it make the guy make somebody have to buy one but you re not going make you put it on the gun so just seems like a waste of legislation money um hum um hum um hum well definitely this happened to me when i was in the third grade uh a friend of uh two of our friends were uh uh went home after school we were playing with a gun and everything and one uh one of them shot and killed the other one yknow accidentally uh it just goes to yknow my dad always had a gun he didn didn have it locked up all the time but yknow wasn necessarily in the same place all the time either yknow i mean so if you weren really looking for it and you know ah you hap to happenstan just happenstance on to it or something you know uh uh i believe nowadays you know that perhaps with the uh with the the guns you know the availability being more people having guns that don know don shouldn have them apparently uh you know they should be uh loc under lock and key uh and as for the you know the parents somebody responsible for you know but see then you get in to catch twenty two because of the legislation i mean you can require i don see how you can require a uh a guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe for the for the gun and and and do all that stuff because that in the case of a burglar comes into your house which is why why you have a gun anyway you have some fear of something like that happening otherwise you shouldn have one unless you re a sportsman and uh then you know you re it not gonna be worth it to have the gun in the first place so uh i do believe that in some the cases uh th the parents or the uh responsible adult should be uh found guilty of that um hum um hum right um well that a that a tough one uh i remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know or it was you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but and to me that fake and uh uh and i never really thought about when was growing up that it was what was real and everything uh i always knew that by i there again know by my dad being a hunter and everything you know i knew that when you shot something that it died it wasn a it wasn a game you know uh and i hate to think that that would cause some kid to go off his rocker and shoot somebody out shi shoot another human being i mean that doesn i don even know why there should be any concern for it guess is what i saying no we we uh i generally tried to keep her childhood her childhood yknow there a time to grow up and there time to be a child and and uh we divorced when she was eight years old so i would get up every saturday morning and watch cartoons with her and stuff like that yknow and tried not to let her watch some of the ones that i that i didn like yknow so and then on movies and stuff uh we let her see some shoot them up movies and everything but the the weirdest movie she seen uh was i remember that i mean lassie i think i could summarize most uh just with a few words of what you re meaning to say i may be wrong but i think you re really meaning to say we must get back to the family there must be two parents and they must be recognize their children and do like you have just discussed uh do with them the sa same and because today we are just drifting and drifting and drifting we uh fifty percent of uh everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today and uh unfortunately it still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this is going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably um once again we are talking about communications too uh and the communications can be ill and they can be great uh as she touched upon uh oh but i feel that pendulum has to swing back from the non family we re headed toward or have been headed toward and get back to a family very basic family orientation i it i it it abhorrent when i hear uh uh oh was it seven ladies who were quote beautiful ladies are now willing to sell sperm uh well that not their sperm well whatever that is they sell uh for ten thousand dollars apiece and to be implanted in the other so that they can produce quote uh a quote beautiful child well a beautiful child uh and if your ve you ve talking about just the physical features i i is meaningless it what is embodied in that body that can be beautiful instead of just the physical features that you look at and that to me is abhorrent such a such an and that indeed is gonna take away from family i ca can in my way of thinking i can imagine that i would uh have my wife producing somebody else child over and i going to have the same thank you that exa exactly fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward or with that child yes to but that uh more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh uh maybe even today it less than that because it a bee been because of a loss of a parent ther the or or inability of a prernt uh or parents uh being able handle those children so yes those things do exist and they will always have some but that a very small percentage though scott yeah um hum yeah right and i well and there nothing wrong with that oh yeah um hum um hum yeah right um hum oh yeah right right um hum exactly um hum right and it all the bucks yeah because people i work with yknow uh there uh there are some people i work with that house payments one guy he has the biggest twenty two hundred dollars a month and a lot of them have like fifteen hundred and up and yknow i bought my house years and years ago and it like four eighty five and i wouldn dare tell them that but it like yknow they because they re always at yknow there are people there that make a lot more money than i do and and they re always like broke but yet yknow like when they go do something they ve gotta have the best of everything the best of th it like yknow yknow you i to me you just hafta kind of think about things little bit and it like yknow do i do i really need to go to um oh what i say um uh i fridays for lunch and spend twelve dollars can i go to taco bell and spend like three and use the other part for maybe like a book for my kid or yknow uh they have like my daughter is in swimming i need the money for a swimsuit well why don i use it for that yknow so it um hum right um hum me too um hum right um hum it it like a car dealer goes yknow the uh player with the blah blah blah blah will only raise your payment another eight dollars and you re like yeah but that about the fourteenth eight dollars you ve added onto this yknow and it all adds up exactly right yeah yeah and yknow a lot of people i work with don see that and yknow they think i a real cheapskate yknow because yknow i i spend money yknow it well i i very selective i mean like uh i love to go to disney world and there are people at work that will not go to disney world just because of what it costs to get in yknow now i drive there i don fly because i really that cheap but yknow i love to fly but i just go oh my gosh and uh yknow but yknow i will do that but yknow like um like at uh thanksgiving time we don buy a butterball turkey we buy a meijer and it like it just as good yknow and yknow we make do yknow oh yeah you don you don use coupons yknow why right because everything that has a coupon has tons of fat tons of sugar and is overpriced yeah right well here here a can of manwich it a dollar fifty and we ll give you fifty cents off well gee if i just use the recipe out the microwave cookbook i can make it at home for like three cents but but yknow why it convenience i can throw it in the microwave and it ll be done in five minutes yknow like mashed potatoes the microwave or yknow it like hello it yknow i i can understand how people do it because they come home from work and it like i don want to be a cook i don want to be a clean up so i ll pay somebody do this pay somebody do that and pretty soon you see all the money they ve been making gone yknow and yeah yeah um hum oh my gosh they just price is so high right right exactly oh you re you re in our neighborhood yeah you re exactly oh well we use i trying to think i it they re mei it a meijer brand i know that what we have it like fruit instead of uh fruit loops yeah and it like what is the difference yknow besides the price it is yeah right right well yknow my and my girls there are certain products that brand name like uh one of them i know is the meijer uh pudding that you can uh take for lunches which they do and it like edventure yknow adventure but it edventure well every once in while hunts will be the same price and they ll be a coupon in the paper so joyce will or joyce or i we we trade she goes the grocery store once then next two weeks i go and the next two weeks she goes so um she ll uh sh yknow she ll buy stuff like that with a coupon and she goes and i go why are you buying that and she goes it was cheaper than the meijer brand and then when we eat it it like it too sweet yknow or it too overpowering or too sugary and the girls even they the same way they would go we don like this it too chocolatey so yknow like the manwich stuff it like they just pour sugar in it i guess because that what people like and so i find that the unbrand stuff well not unbrand but it all like a meijer brand or something like that or food club or something like that yeah oh we do too we make vegetable soup and chili oh yeah yeah right yeah right exactly yeah well see the you you re you re intelligent yknow and the house smells wonderful yknow it like cakes uh birthday cakes yknow i think but my i think my wife was the last one i i make her one and yknow we we trade off and i bought a um um what is it betty crocker at odd lots it was twenty two cents the icing was twenty two cents i made it and everybody goes this is really good it like a sour cream icing i go yeah and they go boy this is really good they go did you buy this and i go no i made it they go really like oh yeah it cost me forty four cents and i go the same cake at meijer would have been like seven dollars or something like that and yknow but uh yknow i i don try to be the the cheapskate i mean i won go without health plan or anything like that but yknow there are certain a like my car i love cars and yknow you take the car to carwash it like seven fifty or eight bucks and you wash in the driveway and it about a quarter yknow it like it takes time if you if you have no time and yknow that i i have friends at work that their the mom is a taxi cab driver and the dad is the worker bee and when they get home they don want to do anything so they pay to have the yard done they do this and it like they have and then they always go we have no money and it like because you pay to do everything yknow slow your life down a little bit yknow it it like you making your soup yknow when if and when you have children when they get my age they re gonna go i can remember walking around the house and going mom is making bean soup or mom is making vegetable soup or mom baked a cake it like uh as opposed to open it up oh here a meijer cake yknow it a lot of memories um hum yeah right i have a neighbor that that way i kn well to me the cholesterol level and the health from that food has gotta be so bad i mean uh my my only downfall is i love taco bell so when i like working out in the yard and mowing and edging and trimming and wash the car and it look up at my watch and i go oh hell i deserve a break i going out to lunch well most people would go somewhere really expensive i go what i want a mexican pizza and a coke li like so that my big treat but uh yknow i um i i not a big fan of eating out either i mean we do like to go to chinese restaurant but and uh when i go we have something nice but um yknow we re not cheap but we don go like we do don we do go to movies every once in a while but yknow we do get a lot from the library because they re free but uh yknow like they re yeah yeah yeah right like magazines i i love read magazines and my wife loves reading magazines because i love all the car magazines and they re a fortune and they re all at the library yknow it like people just don you pay all these taxes and you don use this stuff i mean the library has i mean

will they that that be hard that be that be that would be a challenge uh i no i never i never looked into that but that a good suggestion they yeah like like being the the they re gonna be like like spanish instructors no i i never thought about that not until you just just uh just just said it so yeah or like teaching english as a second language i know they teach those classes here so i was thinking well yknow maybe i should start looking into like teaching classes i was like well i didn know if that was like true or not that you can actually teach around the world because i ve heard i ve heard stories yknow yeah you can you can get they like people pay i like but why but but it like yeah if you say it true i ll look into it because uh okay is it just like a regular job like forty

conversation okay okay so there definitely work ou available if you wanna yknow pursue it um hum you ge did you visit spain while you were there because that one of the places i wanna yeah i can you you went to europe and you missed spain oh okay see that ll be you can plan that as a second honeymoon if sure your wife wouldn object sure honey i can i can do it i can fit it in i was easy major why you become a psych major oh okay yeah basically it is just great to get out yeah no honestly i enjoy i enjoy the psychology classes and i don think i i don think i could be a psych major it just little little too a little too intimidating to me it like lots of like all that freudian stuff it just it just i was uh it just it just wow it this ll blow my mind and so i said okay spanish looks good uh besides just a degree so i can just get out and go and travel like you say a lot of these companies lot these like you say well yknow i don i don know what the requirements are for for some these jobs over in europe but it like maybe it like as long as you have uh any sort of like degree yknow they ll take you clerical whatever because i from columbus it cheap yeah yeah it um no i didn live at home but it like i didn want to pay resi out of state resi out of state residencies like like if i went to indiana okay i have to like pay year out of state tuition so yeah oh yeah i lived in the dorms and got got away from that thank god uh actually i live at uh la riverwatch towers on lane avenue i don know much nicer than the dorms no oh no it like right across the street oh yeah i got i got like two roommates they re i highly recommend the roommate thing so it oh yeah it like i get i get this kind of like a hostle yknow hostel is that how you say it okay hostel environment it like yknow always ge get to know everybody it pretty much an apartment on the whole yknow floor yknow you become friends with everybody real fast so i hoping that same deal when i travel it like it easy to make friends and hook up and yknow say oh you got a job yknow it like yknow hook me up obviously it not something new that been coming i mean it obviously been around for a long time and i mean yeah if they find the cause of it whatever you know that good but at the same time it the cause of it doesn really matter i mean the fact of matter is it there they have to deal with it so if they had a way to cure it then fine but leave that up to the people don say oh well your son gonna be gay he two right now let you know change this so it so it doesn come out to be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people i mean obviously if someone like thirty and they re gay i don see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time um honestly i can say it really bothers me too much um i mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever it doesn bother me at all it just something i don wanna deal with or whatnot um so i mean the fact that i mean two people of the same sex are living together married or whatnot that doesn bother me like i said it just more something that i don know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot it i think it just more because it so wei different than like what you normally see things like that but at the same time i mean i don dislike them or anything for it i mean it it their choice i mean fact of the matter is it doesn have any effect or anything on my life so i don know that kind of a tricky question really because on one hand obviously the kid definitely get uh made fun of and teased and things like that during school but at the same time i mean as long as the love the kids it doesn really matter what sex they are and they treat them well um so i mean that kind of a tough question to answer i mean it almost it something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they be adopting um they obviously wouldn know how to answer that question yeah um i can see where the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into gay people or whatever um just because obviously you basically mimic your parents as far as what you do when you re young and things like that and obviously if you had two male parents or whatever obviously you might be thinking more towards like dating guys and things like that um i don know if that be really a problem though i mean i don know if that would honestly happen um i mean of the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be i normal i guess or you want to say um as far as being heterosexual so i mean i really can say that i see that affecting the kid sexuality at all um hum that wouldn bother me at all um i can say that really bother me too much i mean it the thing as having a woman gym teacher or whatever um i mean fact of the matter is a lot of people out there i guess could be child molesters or whatever i mean it doesn if they re straight or gay or whatever the fact of the matter is i mean they re they re out there and anyone you come across could be getting i don know i guess weird ideas of your kids or whatever i was in the cub scouts so that was like through like sixth or seventh grade or something like that yeah um i don think that really matters honestly um i mean it i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts you re usually eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and i think by time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they and don like um i can see i can see them actually looking at like uh their leader or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore um i mean obviously it should be someone that they but i can say that they be like oh well he does it so i gonna have to do it too or whatever um hum yeah um hum really i didn didn hear about that um i would agree that i regardless of your race you should be able to adopt a child i mean just you re a black kid living with like a white family doesn mean you can still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean it the same with like irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it no different i mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can see it being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for them i mean i can see it being any um there weren a lot but uh there were definitely some there at least i mean um eh about the same number um hum yeah uh huh uh huh yeah they were all right um other columbus sally is from columbus i don know if you know who she is um um hum go if you i yeah it only it still seven yeah i i i like to talk about columbus in some ways i like it in some ways it not my favorite place but it seems like it relatively safe place to live although that coming from me i ve been robbed at gun point or knife point about times i think columbus yeah maybe five um i drove a taxi cab for couple summers and i was robbed think twice driving the cab and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around mount vernon area and uh they got very little money but i wasn and i was also robbed about times delivering pizzas for domino in the north area really uh a couple times were down a little bit south of campus fourth street and fifth avenue near there fourth street and seventh and but once was right practically on sixteenth at near high street i was robbed there yeah near the that united christian center that right there on fifteenth avenue they always have a way to get you out of the yknow they ll order pizza for someplace that dark they ll be waiting there for yeah that yeah yeah i have experience in that and i i thankful that it was always a sort of thing although what going on your and your body isn that you know that possibility don you you re not supposed to carry that much money around and it mu as much to protect the people after you as it is protect you because the ra the word to get out that we don have money it doesn yeah thing go head i one thing i was thinking yknow that i have a perspective on that maybe lots lots of people don is how columbus has grown up yeah and just a couple things i remember when i first started going the unitarian church up here on um well when i was a in sunday sunday school we we drove there from reynoldsburg by going think reynoldsburg new up to uh morse road and then over on morse road to high street so it was ah it was on the back you know and that was before the mid when the freeway i seventy was through and a lot of lot of you don of havoc that when a freeway is built through the middle of a town because you to take out houses do and ih you can sort of realize it if you ever around the area and go one of the little side that dead ends because the freeway is there and see the side street on the side and you think about there must have been twenty or houses had take here to put um hum right right that right so that that was an went to up hamilton and over to nah and on morse or up new albany road to morse uh nuh and over to street of that was out there on morse road i don know if you know morse road very well but there out out out by karl there shopping center after shopping center after shopping center after housing after but we this the mid when we drove up that way in the early sixties there was there were fields there were farms there were there were you know none of that out and it just it just amazing the urban sprawl has taken out there some ways ts it it i guess it necessary but it just you reminisce about the way it use to look and and um i was just at a place last night i was at this a meeting for the national wildlife ah they re planning for madison county and um there were some there was some talk about that and it seemed to me there were people that were in favor of the refuge there people that were opposed to the wildlife refuge mostly people that lived there near there farmers and and but it seems like the one thing that pre almost there agreed on was didn wanna see the place go to be over run by condos and housing developments and um that we somebody was about the difference between development here in the united states and in um and how development in in europe tends to take note of the fact that space is not so you ll have more uh more people living one or one apartment uh and they ll go up rather just up space yknow they they re about preserving space and preserving wild space mhm that the this country is that there space in the states and north america that you have all these incredible and still find wild between them yeah mon monroe it not mon it not monroe monroe is it okay okay yeah um um hum yeah crummy new crummy new apartment buildings yknow constructed yes yeah yeah yeah there no co there no there no concept behind you re right you so to the area commissions are to work on that and unify i used to be on the university commission and in the campus area that of worked on although we some of the other commissions in columbus are almost strictly they on only talk about the of buildings people can build and the university area commission we dealt with that we dealt with whether something would be commercial residence we dealt with yeah a lot yeah um hum um um um well i got can tell but i think hour is up sorry well it not it not that i wouldn keep talking but you probably sort of have a limited yeah um hum right right yeah huh that um um hum that good it better in terms of the uh city government seems to the people seem to be more aware of what they re doing and it not oh well i ll just do this it kind of like you know there some brains down there yeah i a democrat and i ve never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and i always adored mark hatfield i didn vote for him while i was out was the weirdest thing because i thought he was a great but i think uh personally mike coleman was good i i ve met uh well we had a diamond jubilee at the village and and coleman and teater both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i didn think that bi there was much that much difference in them idalogically i think yknow she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but um i in terms of having a black mayor i think that good for columbus i thi i hope so yeah hm oh that a real major question isn uh hm no i don think it too bad i mean um well uh well we could go into the issue of uh the columbus board of education what his name he is always moss bill he always oh this is rashist and that rashist but i don think it too bad in columbus i know there re places lots worths like the south and so on course uh who who really knows the race issue is such a big question i like him personally and when he was running for uh mayor i would have voted for him i met him and everything but i guess he just is plays the devil a advocate all the time at the uh at the the um school board meetings i i heard this is just a rum you want gossip in here want some gossip the gossip i heard was that um um the superintendent of schools said that if he was reelected she was going to resign and so they gave her a big so he she must be a thorn in her yeah he was he gonna always be reelected he got his gr yeah i uh his wife a teacher and i understand an excellent teacher so i think he has real good information um that he works with well i think she maybe res uh retired last year but she had a uh taught columbus for twenty years or something like that and so i think his information is good but i guess way handles things sometimes gets through to yeah um hum he always has whenever he run well i thought he was gonna be elected uh mayor too but he didn there but i don know what that was about but um uh yknow he got his constintuats and their gonna reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think he what he makes a mistake is saying labeling things racist that are not ne necessarily racist but anyway um hum maybe we re beyond that we shouldn always be saying um yeah yeah well um that i don know wha ih how to explain that especially if anybody gonna to this um i had a friend that taught classes human potential classes was very interested and participated very in depth in the human potential movement so um uh a a gentleman by the name of alexander everett uh who really is the father of the human potential movement moved out there and he was gonna have a group of people work out there and uh and he said that yknow i was qualified well when we got out there it just fell through yknow and we all just lived our lives but i was glad that yknow that he got me out there because i adored i just i just loved it out there oh it just so everyth the environment of course is incredibly beautiful um and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships and um yknow i think it a frie much friendlier place and then uh i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just don have poverty well if anybody in poverty in oregon it because they ve chosen to live a simple life it not a yknow because they can get jobs and things like that although the economy in is not that great but yknow they say in eugene that even the dishwashers have they well the the um the level of the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country so yeah they have a lot of well educated people who aren out to just make a bunch of money so it makes for an very intellectual interesting environment but people are trying to live simply there and i kind of agree with that oh yeah well i don know um oh well in oregon well i was down in california for three months and uh and uh i went to the vegetable produce stand and i took my umbrella and of course it doesn rain too much and i said oh i from oregon and i always think it gonna rain and he says well i from washington and i know it gonna but uh um well something happening of course to the planet on uh weather patterns and uh there been having droughts in oregon which is so strange but when i was there it it um it rains from november through june it rains i mean tha the the the they say on the weather in the morning showers changing to rain and then the next day say rain changing to and it does but they don use umbrellas i mean they just go through it they re just so used to it and they wear that kind of jacket yknow uh no because it not a hard rain and the first year i was there it was pretty hard to get used to it but there no cold real cold winter and uh and then from july august september and october just gorgeous just so gorgeous but i like i like that fog and that mist and those evergreen yeah it i it is yeah or you could do the university of oregon it a very nice very small university but it nice i forget the name well i don think there a university of portland but there two two or yes there is a university i can think of which one it is right now speaking of opinions did you see the paper today about the thing in seattle they re having this big dre big and well i live on the south west side and work in dublin i don get to campus very much i get to campus but it usually up to the stadium of the stadium uh studios yeah i work on the auction up there so i sorta avoid the ca main campus it been a long time since i been around here uh fawcett center so it it not even really on campus yeah uh uh okay wait you know where the schott is yeah it over the there it on olentangy down there north of there okay yeah they did it is warm in here and now now it now you uh huh that fine um i well my title senior consulting data base specialist work for company called it in dublin um i work in it hard to say what i do i consult on a lot of projects we do ah we develop a lot of software and projects and i consult on the data base side no we run an online system where people us connect to our system and build a data bases or or access the data bases it da din da uh ev everything has in their library collection is in our system their records came from us uh huh yeah th the well they yeah and we do that for tens of thousands of libraries yeah uh essentially all the big academics most the uh i it actually all over the world it international the li yeah probably cause we have some public systems most of them are for the librarians but there some for public too yeah right yeah we don have a web browser version that what we re working on now that what i ve been working on yeah well tha there is a web access to some of our systems when that all la we re ma putting a more uniform one up for everything and i don it may be they has some system but they can also connect to our system for things they don have in their system and it so i not sure what system you re talking yeah and i don know what is set up like yeah they might connect to us they might not it a lot of the it looks a and feel is a lot a lot the same yeah yes and your display might be different but it it basic information and i and we developed the system that people started doing that on is sharing the data um actually it started here on campus and now we re independent yeah no i worked at the library when i was a student actually i that what got me interested and so i went to library school and yeah uh case western cleveland you re not from around here are you well oh okay a lot of exciting stuff going on now at the libraries it not not the old old lady in the bun yeah yeah and the web has really changed that no i work for the company but i consult on a lot of projects within the company um yeah we re doing pretty well it about a hundred fifty million dollar business oh thirty forty thousand it international yeah yeah i don well we just sort of started making a big splash in australia in about the last three years so uh they they may now they may have yeah yeah they they a all of them there actually other systems too and they all have pretty much the same look but as you said there little details that are different and oh yeah i ve been doing it i ve been there twenty over twenty years so yeah i enjoying it it always changing oh the technology is changing i mean the web is really revolutionized what we re doing uh well it anybody can connect to the web uh before we used to have a that only people in the back room of the libraries connected and it was all mainframe and then people got on their desk and suddenly the whole world of who could access any system and what they could do on their desk changed uh and now we ve gone more out in the public work in the public scene do it not just for the people in the back room uh and then the web yknow people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with libraries before now we re trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody who just can wants to connect to us most of them that are our site now we have more of a distributed system where we can actually go out and connect to others people connect to us and then go out as a gateway to other places yeah we re getting more into that now but that wasn easy so easy before either the yknow the web again then that has changed it no we we haven uh yknow there always that uh but we haven yeah it can be a problem uh if you get hit know like if our system would shut down it would cost us i don remember what it is yknow tens of thousands of dollars for every hour that we re down if our data base would be trashed our main base would be trashed we have real serious problems and it could take weeks or months to rebuild it uh yeah so it could be a problem uh we ve got people working in that area wait a minute i don know what you mean oh uh well yeah well librarians traditionally have problems with and it like a form of censorship yknow big brother things have always had problems with that uh i i don know it it hard to balance it if somebody out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else it i don know how to balance it what do you mean ri right right and that yeah and again if it criminal activity you want someon you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it i i i not doing anything i want anybody to know about yeah and then what to prevent them from going and finding out what some companies doing what research is and that the part that a threat on the web too is that you can connect in somebody system and they don know that you re there and you can see what they re doing if they doing research uh yknow developing a new product or something you can yeah it corporate espionage and i sure that going on and i ve heard cases of it yeah well and the thing is people are real sharp and no matter what you do they ll find a way aro yknow it nobody found a way to prevent people from in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it i haven been back there for about ten ten years um hum i like to move back down there but there just isn any work yknow so unless you own your own company so mm that basically is remodeling dry wall and stuff like that and that the appalachia area yeah um hum it be great if somebody yknow they gonna want to pump all this money into it but unfortunately whenever the government pumps money into an area yknow that tends to be like a uh foreign country gets it yknow and well uh here yeah they gave us ten thousand here a dollar have fun yeah it uh yeah they ge they ve got two different uh articles in there uh about it well they had a big article uh back when uh who was it jesse jackson was down there or something what a couple years ago or something and uh he made a concerted effort to try to let people know how pover poverished how poverty is down there and everything but then you go to a lot of other extremes yknow where you set there and these people wouldn want to live in columbus so yknow you can give them a a million dollar house up here and and an income for the rest of their life they don want that they want to live down where they where they re feel comfortable at um hum um hum um hum um hum um hum i moved just just uh moved into uh up there one sixty one cleveland area uh but i lived up area for years but i just moved back up there and uh why i left it was because of the the city the traffic and everything where you get around campus yknow it a lot and they sell hustle hustle hustle but down here even with with the kids and everything going to school but basically it kind of laid back uh where up there it all go go go uh um hum you re going to cross the street yknow four lane highway and you re sitting there going hey or do you want to run over me is that what you want to do um hum um hum so uh but it a an adjustment to get back into it but but i i do like it up there better as far as uh possibilities of uh working closer to home and stuff and nat not not having to worry to about a bus and um hum um hum um hum i ve hag i got a couple three applications in about the kroger and uh uh but a dishwashing job for saint angela nursing home which i kind of like doing stuff for people that like that yknow uh i worked at a custodian at saint rafael uh uh home for the aged but i had a problem dealing with a one on one basis with the older patients because they were they were just visiting yknow they weren there to uh stay yknow they were yknow you get kind of on a personal basis with them and take couple days off and you come in and say what happened to oh she passed away on su oh jesus ruined all i told her i was bringing her a pack of cigarettes yknow you ever get that so i mean uh yeah you get kind of attached to them and to them and everything and oh or then they get sick sick yknow and they move them up to i aw useta always sit there and say yknow this is the only place i ever worked where the a move up stairs isn a promotion yknow it um hum i like to uh eventually uh on immediate future yknow get something more permanent as far as work goes uh uh better standard of living uh uh i a veteran so i ve got health care and but i need to get some other things done though um continue to um grow in wisdom yknow as far as uh maybe spirituality or something yknow uh and eventually get kind of my own business where yknow uh i have a want that i want to get a uh a spiritual bookstore yknow and then have uh things for everybody yknow just come in and reading room browse yknow read the stuff yknow take time off to relax because i think one of the problems with stress is uh and i think people are are right in saying that we don get enough exercise but uh but i think you hafta exercise mentality something once in while too and and that is trying to make it grow and do a to other levels of of uh atmosphere um hum inspiration motivation i useta have a business when i had first quit ashland i had a motivational tape business and everything but uh uh i tended to let that go downhill do the cocaine and other things yeah um hum in the wrong atmos it was just wasn the right time and uh it just i had money yknow fact i had i got like a settlement like thirty some thousand dollars not a settlement but when i sold my stocks and everything i got like thirty some thousand dollars and put about five thousand here five thousand there still had twenty yknow started a business and money was coming in and uh using the money for other we were using the money for other things and not realizing that hey you re suppo be putting that money back in the business yknow but i was running around with bunch of other people that basically were doing the same thing yknow so um hum um hum um hum because yeah i hope to uh at forty nine yknow i ve i ve learned a heck of a lot uh lot of things i have wouldn want to know yknow but i think i think i they ve been for the good as long as you you turn them around and and make them a positive statement for you but that why i really like to have is the uh uh a bookstore just my down around campus yknow and people can come in and go over there and relax yknow and um hum um hum yeah yeah something the coffee uh doughnuts yknow or um hum but having having done it before yknow and uh knowing where i went wrong yknow uh that wouldn happen again uh talk about all that shit for a while but that was again that was back in the uh actually it was in the nineties early nineties but yknow i was been doing it when we were we were as a recreation type of thing yknow not as a uh daily yknow um hum somebody come knocking on our door oh yeah okay oh yeah oh yeah yeah stupid but i like to do something like that then uh uh i wouldn mind having uh uh some kind of place for uh yknow you see a lot of uh different down and out type people and everything and and really nobody really trying to help them or nothing yknow and uh uh i like to think that maybe even this thing yknow could be like a sanctuary for them to come in and get some peace of mind or something yknow so um hum um hum um hum yeah i can i two thirty five yeah i was a little late though when i got here but i was born in los angeles california in the mid fifties and when i was less then one year old my family moved to columbus uh the first place we lived in columbus was in whitehall near the corner of hamilton and uh um then shortly after that we moved out to reynoldsburg and i ve i ve lived there until my sophomore year in high school um went and during my sophomore year in high school we moved to and i graduated from high school i went to oberlin college and then i i graduated from there in nineteen seventy six and moved back to columbus and did a variety of jobs in columbus um then i went to ohio state university from nineteen eighty three to ninety one and got a master degree in geology so i an alumnus and um after that i had another variety of jobs um but i ve lived and well during that time i guess i lived in the university area for a number of years i lived on sixteenth avenue near the fairgrounds um let see i number of different jobs currently i work at uh in hilliard and i live in worthington uh in the south part of worthington i renting a room from my mom and i yes and i sort of took a step backwards but right now i saving up money and trying to buy a house somewhere it something i sort of kicking myself wishing i would have done about twenty or thirty years ago cause it would have been a lot cheaper right right it wasn a top for me then yeah one yeah i don really have any childhood recollections of california yeah um hum um hum right well and i right now i forty five years old so i ve lived in or around columbus for most of forty four years excluding times when i was away at school northern ohio it near elyria which is west of cleveland yes um hum right right um hum i studied there i studied music and chemistry and ended up with a double major bachelors degree there not doing really at the same time studying music for a while and then studying chemistry yeah no i i clipping couldn i didn think of any projects where i could use both um hum well that interesting thing i i not in geology i um i actually making more money right now in music than i am in geology but i making most my money in something that irrelevant to most my that has nothing to do with any of um yes i play um principle horn in the uh symphony orchestra and um last year i was in a professional singing group but i also in a number of volunteer choirs um the choir at the first unitarian universalist church in and um a small choir where i work which i got the opportunity to conduct today the conductor was the conductor was um not at work so um i do a lot of music my spare time mostly uh but uh unfortunately i didn get a job in geology and i i don have a full time job music either either one of those would be nice but i um i went back i came back to ohio state um in see four through ninety and got a teaching certificate in for secondary science and i taught for a year a at a small school in lancaster catholic high school down there and um left there uh part of was my fault i wasn very good at discipline in the classroom so that was probably one of the biggest problems i had but uh no in fact the principal when she interviewed me asked me that and i when we re raised in the unitarian sunday school it a it almost an indoctrination in tolerance for other so you re better off with me then somebody that believes is the only one true religion yes but it was interesting um um they did have uh assemblies where they had religious assemblies um religion wasn a all uh it wasn all invasive in this school but they did have assemblies and uh for religious holidays and that kind of thing and i remember thinking uh it it interesting that the concept of eating somebody flesh blood it almost cult like and i and i starting to think well what really separates a a religion from a cult and i think it just the this social acceptance of it really almost um you know how many people are in it what number divides them i not really yeah yeah yeah well i i like um i was i ve been very politically active at various times my past and um especially i guess in the late seventies and early eighties i was very active in um alternative fighting against nuclear power and um been active in various times in animal rights movements and uh political campaigns uh foreign policy kinds of debates that kind of kind of thing and one thing that i ve noticed a a lot is there are a lot of there are well there wide spectrum but in the um there a lot of liberals in the catholic church too you know for example one of the that they were in the fore front on was uh justice for um people in central and latin america yeah um hum arch bishop romaro yeah in el salvador that um hum um hum that right that right yes so there are there are conservative and progressive wings for in every religion i sure even probably unitarian universalist although um i ve heard that they conservative unitarian churches are in new england around boston where it was started and there are some that are relatively conservative there but um for the most part it it what you would call liberal religion yeah are ya great where you from oh okay okay um um hum um hum my brother my older brother lived in bloomington for a while and he ran a music store on the square in the center of town might have just been called music i not sure sold guitars and square right across from the court house yeah i think it was the east side i think it um it was while ago he hasn been there for a while yeah uh huh right right it probably went out of business when he left no but i ve i have two daughters and two sons ma and i heard my daughters talking about they want to do something special for my sixty fifth birthday so they given me a party on my sixtieth so i don know what it going to be but i think they ll do they they talked about something in the way of a trip so maybe something the three of us can do together so i just sitting back waiting it was a nice birthday party yeah i don do a whole lot of it but i like to travel she th there there are wanderlust right there she travels all the time all by herself really um hum particularly huh how many times you ve been in ireland um hum you were you had to go home because mother was ill year later uh huh hum um hum raised eleven hum hum um hum those are unsettling times though yknow yeah did he really janet we just had a man who took time to sh walk us all the way through the hospital walk us all the way through the he sure was oh yeah um hum my answer to your question is has this eroded i gonna answer with the word using the word respect uh yes i feel that uh this has eroded over time uh there not the respect for our elders i don necessarily mean elders in terms of the uh chronological age but i talking in terms of generations the uh there less respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the great grandparents uh i gonna give you a first hand example i just had a uh conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now twenty uh she will come over to my house grandpa house and she ll come in and she ll flop down in a chair uh and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it uh i don ever tell her uh do to do things and i ve pointed out to her that whenever we went to visit grandpa or great grandfather uh if the if we saw weeds out in the garden we went out and we hoed the garden if we if or the chicken house need to be cleaned uh and they hadn gotten to it that day we went out and cleaned the chicken house we would say grandpa is it okay if we go out and clean your chicken house well course you knew very well it was gonna be okay but a matter of respect though you ask is it okay for us to do it and uh now with her uh i can have dishes out there in the sink uh that are left there for from breakfast maybe lunch and uh she she ll walk out there and will say well grandpa how come your dishes aren done and then she turns around walks away that right you uh huh and and she may then go ahead and say well now sometimes she ll ask and sometimes she doesn but lets assume she did she ll ask is it alright if i have some of this she goes ahead and gets the dishes out so forth she puts them right in there in that sink uh with those other dishes makes no efforts to clean them and i i i ve seen this in many many many incidents but i giving you this is very first hand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society today so yes in my opinion definitely it eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect she just used the word penalty penalty has nlots of different definitions each individual has a mental picture what the word penalty means based upon their own experiences all i wanna take just and it say it penalty in a very general sort of way whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left lets come back to about the middle i concerned that we are getting away from penalties completely and i feel it absolutely essential that we have penalties we have for everyone for everyone really across the board uh we we re getting away from penalty we re getting away from penalty uh uh so many people i just to give an example talking about adults i just read uh statistics the other day right here kah columbus where uh it was an extremely high percent i can quote the percentages of people who uh ignore uh yellow lights and and of consequence they are ending up going through red lights and there many many many accidents taking place uh i and we it used to be that you could place uh uh an a law enforcement officer the corner if it happened and he immediately he would uh penalize you by giving your ticket and you face the court as the case may be well now we have passed so many little ordinances and laws and change the enforcement policies and this kinds of things well the poor police officer he can even do that any longer he got if somebody uh runs through red light you almost have to hit somebody and then be accused for going through the red light he can just arbitrarily be there because that called i think the word harassment plays a part you are harassing that individual because you were standing there waiting for him to commit this problem when i let just get away from that example you can talk about whether you did you were carrying uh i don want to get in to the guns and knives and stuff in the school that enough for ours does that too they re great sounds a lot like our dog yeah my sister and her husband just moved back they went out to nebraska for a year and then yeah i got the opportunity um a a company that my sister had worked for wanted her to come back and so they offered to move them back and um it kind of worked out because her husband was losing his job any how just kind of one of those okay let do it and so um my parents retired here let see they ve been here i don know four or five years maybe and my sister was here like i said and then moved out just gotten came back a couple months ago um my grandfather just passed away but he was here in a nursing home for about a year um indirectly yes um the reason my sister was here only when i got here but i was in one of those yknow youth stupid uh psychopathic relationships shall we say and i kind of needed to disappear and um uh we never told him where sh she had just moved um so i just came down here then so was one of those things get away from it all yeah yeah so um i came down here because he knew where my parents lived and plus columbus was a lot more opportunity so indirectly it was a very bad reason that i came here but it worked out yknow so right exactly oh um hum well i even had that i mean my family oh my sister said if you didn leave him i was gonna staple your hair to the but um she was jo she wasn kidding though becau yknow it just one of tho oh i can help him yknow i ve learned i the caretaker like i roll my eyes because it you can change people that much stupid but um yknow it weird because it was terrible but because he was real controlling and yknow you start to doubt yourself like did i say that right and like he wouldn let me sleep so then you start to lose that yknow what i mean real you really do start to lose your mental yeah woo and um um yknow at the time i was like i not gonna get anything out of this and it was misery and what not but i ve met people that have been in much worse situations and at least i can kind of relate to them so in a in one way it kind of a blessing so yeah um hum yeah yeah yeah um hum yeah oh yeah yeah yeah it very fortunate frustrating i my sister has an undergrad in psychology and she worked at like um one of those what do you call them those secretive houses like for women and their battered children that yknow you re not supposed to location and what not and she used to get so frustrated um because they always go back and i understand that mentality now because i went back but i ll tell you the reason i left st it sound stupid but he took my teddy bear which i loved and i ved had for not since i was a child but at least five years at that time and he just he knew i loved it and just took it and ripped it and and that split second i was like okay he gonna do this to me he gonna do this to my kids ain no way um hum wow um hum yeah it is that important right even though it an inanimate object it all kind of came together right and i was glad i realized that i nobody would ever mess with my children not even their father my husband or whatever and i realized that so it was like ok i not gonna do it for me but i gonna do it for the future and and that helped because like i said it all came together because i don understand how people can let their kids be hurt but i i not built that way yeah yeah um um hum um hum yeah sure yeah yeah um hum um hum yeah it always kind of scary i think you really need to get away from that to get your self back or you re just gonna go back because you don know any other way at the time um hum yeah right right but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute yknow uh it so obvious hello but oh yeah but just that freedom yknow to do what you want to get some sleep to eat to take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what not and then it really clear but if you don get that and you re always thrust back into it i don think you can break free so yeah that true yeah um hum yeah yeah yeah yeah um hum um hum um no which is i very grateful he did like go past my haren parents parents house and things like that but then they moved here and even though it public records like who owns a house um luckily we haven had that because we purchased the house my husband and i before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the deed has my maiden name on it but uh no luckily and that been almost ten years so hopefully hopefully no i just uh basically got out of a a a relationship it was like a rebound type thing um i was in a relationship for like three years and um he was cheating on me and so i felt really bad and why does he pick her and and then i met this guy who seemed wonderful and then turned out to be not so wonderful so i made a lot of yknow you look back and you see things you were like this is real obvious but at the time i think you i was like um a i can either change them or if they love me we can communicate and change things and yknow that type of thing yeah right first of all they re not really in love with you and secondly you re so when i came here um i didn date for over five years on purpose i don think it was supposed to be that long on purpose but i wouldn let myself date for a couple years after just trying to figure out yknow okay this is what i doing wrong let not do it again di di di di and then asked me out for a few more years yeah so that worked uh so i really hadn dated for a long time and then i started dating again and what weird is you almost go right back in to the patterns because you re so scared you re gonna be alone you see yourself going oh i can be with this person and you know in your head this person not for and then luckily um indirectly i met my husband four four years ago i don know it been awhile four and a half years ago something like that so yeah yeah right yeah it was like oh this makes sense and he might have these other wonderful things that i used to but he got all of so i ll get that little slice and take the so that worked out um um actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that i not sure i mean i know no one come to like hey you can get on this and you can get on that i mean i know my teacher she said i think it called um a or something a and they pay you to go to school they could be paying me to go to finish high school and they can also they ll also pay me to finish college and and they ll help me out yknow i haven seen anyone come to offer me that or or tell i mean she the first i never even heard of it and um there anoth there all kinds of programs that yknow like there this one that um where like say i i live with my mom my mom can be getting paid from the government for me to be living there yknow because she kind of helps me out yknow and i don know what that was called i mean i just now finding this stuff out yknow it like i guess i can apply for um welfare and that i mean not that i i don want to be on welfare it like it like a a down when i want to go up yknow yeah like have someone come and yknow and tell them you have this much time or yknow i wouldn recommend you stay on this program this long and a i i know there programs that if you get on it and they pay you you hafta pay that money back after you get on your feet well i mean i think someone should be able to come out and and tell you about these things and let you know what you can and hafta do to yknow do this or she she um she doesn know all about all of them yknow like i get she found out about the a just like we all yknow and i guess like a couple of the kids in the class had i had it or on it yknow and she was like oh what that and she was like oh i hafta figure out that stuff yknow she called uh one of the case workers and figured out the whole program and she come in and told another girl about it she told me about it hum uh edward the fourth edward the fourth it his dad his dad dad and his dad yeah he the father definitely hum yeah he lives with me and i mean that my engagement ring very big i mi probably down the line because like we re still struggling to get up yknow we re waiting for that million dollar chec there that twenty one million dollar check to hit the the doorstep yknow i finishing high school um actually heard about a program where you can finish college on the internet but i not sure how it gonna work yknow i mean i i the um web site is go under construction i was like darn it so then yknow my aunt works here and um all my cousins well most of them graduated here so kind of want to follow them go with the flow but i yknow i did some other ones yknow emailed and yknow if you have this program can you tell me something about it and and it was actually i think it was stanford it was on a tv show i think it was like extra or something i don know what it was and they were had a program on where um these older students yknow met for the first time in uh uh at their graduation yknow they finished their whole college on the internet and i said well that would be very easy for me and i could do it at my convenience like when he asleep i can go and do that i think it would make it a lot easier to get up getting up is a very hard task very big bags like i can see at the beginning he did perfectly but now he doing this i want up at four clock kind of thing and you give him a bottle and he goes back to sleep but yknow i don want to walk all way to make bottle for him at four clock it like i can see feeling my way through the hallways and stuff well yeah sort oh man whoa everyone like you got it lucky i like well it gonna catch up just wait i waiting for it i don know what i gonna do but i waiting for it um well if he has that bottle at four he ll wake maybe up around six or seven i normally wake up at six anyway so it doesn matter so i ready for him then yeah hum even harder no i think we re only friends inside the class i mean a lot of them i ve known um from middle school and following them up and yknow they just all go their different ways like the one girl i was friends with at world park i mean she was a grade lower than me but when that we seen each other in the halls like hey what up and and we talk and yknow what going on and we re doing this after school and that in high school i didn know anything i i know she was bad and that was it that was all i knew and it it kind of weird because you when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for you re grounded oh yeah what you do oh god yknow a i feel like a i was a parent before i was a parent yknow i ve that the way it felt it was like some of my friends like like this guy i used to hang out with he he used to run into lockers in high school i like i that is so kid yeah just to watch the people go what did you just do that for yknow and i like and what grade are you in and how old are you and i know like one point in time it like we don want to hang out with you crystal i like well fine i don i ll go hang out with them it like they they still need to do a lot of growing up they most of my friends are they re gi they act like kids no unfortunately not yeah because i have a like a problem with um getting to know people yknow like i shy at first and um then it takes yknow a while yknow get to know the person and then i become friends with them it like for some reason i didn want to do that um columbus public oh yeah not really i mean yeah there some little flaws but mean the way i grew up it was probably like back in the day like the catholics against the columbus publics yknow like the richies against the poories that how i kind of see it but when i went to northland people were think northland like a rich school but the way i see it is no not really i mean we do live in a big yknow housed area yknow the houses are like huge but um um i mean columbus public they they got some work to do too like the other night i was watching tv and uh an elementary school overdosed a kid on like some a i think it was a drug to calm him down so he not so hyper and they like overdosed him like twice in a day and then when he goes home his mom even overdosing him because he they re overdosing him yeah i mean he he um hum right well yeah to tell you truth the school i went to sucked it i mean yeah it was very hard for me to stay in school i could ve easily quit like that because the teachers didn i went to a columbus public school and it they didn care i mean i i went through elementary and middle school with straight a and then got there and i was on to yknow and it just was really the teachers didn care yknow if you learned you learned if you don you don if you don come to school you don they don care that was how my school was so i don there wa i don there was nothing there that really i can remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more than high school i mean i i was very good in math um very good in math i mean i was i did pretty good in all of the subjects yeah home ec i i yeah i sure that was useful to per for people that didn cook or do anything it showed them how to turn a oven on or well no actually my mom didn she was a very bad cook so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she still do doesn she lives with a man now and he does all the cooking still so i ve i i i ve learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i love to cook um hum well i i a meat eater so i make a lot of yknow pork chops steaks and yknow beef stew he likes meat too yeah he li he loves some and he loves chicken that like his favorite food but yeah he i he is a picky eater which he lu yep he he doesn like everything yep pork chops and macaroni and cheese he ll eat that it yeah yeah um i took a class for word prossing word word processing one and two i took those and um tell you the truth i can remember if they taught me how to balance a check book out i don remember that at all i know how to i know how to do it but i not sure who taught me how to do it yeah yep um yeah uh my brother didn know what the heck to do with a check book yeah hum yeah i think so i think in high school there was or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school because there were pregnant girls my high school um hum there was pregnant girls in middle school um hum it around morse road yeah um hum yeah no it was cutoff predomli it was more black than white tell you truth or it might have been even but now it more black than white definitely now because i i live in a neighborhood where it preno it mostly black than white and that where i ve always lived my whole life um hum um hum um hum yep um i don know if you could say that i there were a lot of problems i mean i even had problems like on the school bus and stuff yknow but i had black so uh i didn have much yknow much problems yeah there there were both there were there were um white skinheads at our school yknow that were racist against me for hanging around black people um i didn really have uh i guess i there i sure there was black people that were racist too but i didn yknow not in school i didn have problems really much in school with that well they ll suspend you yeah or put you in peek or something yknow if there any problems between students i don think they that they never would sit down with the students and have them talk it out yknow they might send them to peek or something oh we i know what did it mean well it you instead of going to your classroom you go into a room where you have you sit and the teacher gives you all your work for the day and you can talk or anything yeah boring very boring um hum um hum yeah yeah well they were none of my friends that were pregnant and i not sure they yknow i just remember couple girls that were pregnant i don i weren wasn friends with them and i not sure about who their boyfriends were or anything like that no i don think they did hum um um hum yeah well maybe i i yknow uh because i was yknow i was fooling around too when i got in ninth grade and i don know i didn wear any condoms or do anything like that and i just am very lucky for never getting pregnant no hum um what really um wha when aids star i had a a one of my best friend brother had died of it and that and that uh really after that i like to yknow was like i have to wear a condom because i was scared to de death to get aids yknow so i did wear condoms yknow probably after a few years of having sex without condoms but but it wasn the worry about getting pregnant it was the worry about getting aids um hum because i don know it just was like if i get pregnant i get pregnant that you don know of what you really have to go through of having a baby yknow because i guess i really didn care if hey if i got pregnant i got pregnant it didn it didn really yknow register in my mind that this will rui yknow not ruin but it was it will change your whole life yeah um hum yeah yeah i got on birth control probably when i was like sixteen or seventeen but still i didn take the pills all the time and yknow that wasn very good for me well i would i would sit down and talk to her like yknow if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control and suggest the shot the cutoff te the depoprovera because that what i on now and that way you don miss any that lasts for three months yknow and i that what i would suggest for her yknow well i once upon a time there was a gentleman named and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot every time i fan myself it goes up it a feature sorry i ll stop go ahead doesn matter when i clear my throat and you re listening to it it gonna be annoying as hell yeah my apologies in advance we re getting more fun stuff all the time but predominantly it still got way too much cowtown personality um hum oh i live in albany therefore i cool i was born in new york and therefore i cool yeah that how it since i was five that makes it twenty years went to worthington high school and in the end of my third year it became worthington kilbourne high school and thomas worthington high school and so i got to be the first graduating class of this brand new school that they built because the old one had just overflowed beyond all and we called it the uh the taj mahal because they spilled bunches of information into it or bunches of money and it was pretty it was fun to be the first class in the school cause everything is brand new um hum cause they re so stylish what they should do is just tell people that their kids don get to go to school i bet the attitude changes pretty fast but it such a good idea did i go to ohio state yes yes i told you that earlier though but yeah it wasn being recorded then so it okay it um well it started out as uh computer science under the college of arts and sciences but then there was this whole foreign language requirement and a bad incident with a counselor and eventually i became a a proud member of the college of business i had foreign i had french in the sixth grade and i got a i had um german and spanish in the seventh grade and then the uh eighth grade i had french and then ninth grade i got um in the ninth grade i had french in the tenth grade i had french and my junior year of high school i had french and my re report grades went straight straight straight and i said i think i should get out now and taking it i didn take french my senior year but then the arts and sciences came around and said you will have a foreign language requirement and i like well i already know all this french i might as well take more french and a first year freshman year of french it was not fun my second year sophomore i started in for another year of french and about three quarters of way through the year i realized that every day was all about dreading french class before and after i would spend up to french class going no no french class then all after french class going god that was so miser i was like this is stupid this is no way to live my life so i went to my counselor i said no french class that how it going be see you need to figure out how i not going end up taking fren we have to take a french class you have i was like no don have to take a french class said well you have to take a foreign language you have to i said look i not taking any more foreign languages we re gonna figure out how to avoid this or no you have to take a for i said look lady there are sixty thousand students in this university and if you think that i going to believe for a second that they all take foreign language classes after having seen the college of foreign language you re insane there another way to do this experience what is it we you have to take a foreign language i said okay we re gonna change the question a little bit here you have two options now tell me how to avoid taking foreign language or tell me how to talk to somebody who isn you cause that apparently all i ve got available said well you to take i said how do i talk to somebody else she said well you have to talk to me as long as you re in this college i was like where the so i became a proud business major no it doesn mm hmm there are some um foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding yes there an there a feeble attempt to make you well rounded is what there is but there no specific language it curious isn it yeah and as i got older to lose interest i don have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you i just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like yeah you should get out before you actually fail the class and um it was it was just unpleasant i think i was stupid i think that what it amounts to not that i was not able to pick up the data i was just um that uh unwise in in whether or not it was worth while and i believe that it uh horribly worth while now and yet now i not taking classes so at the end of march i go europe i travel around for a minimum hundred days with a backpack on my back and outside of english french is a horribly popular language for different countries to have as a second language so i think it be extraordinarily useful to me now if i had a greater understanding of french re reality strikes um wander around look at things talk to people yes minimum hundred days um hum i had three months and then it got postponed then it got postponed again and i was like this is stupid in exchange for postponing it again my rationale was fine i ll give myself another ten da because it was also a nice like a hundred is such a pretty round number um i ve a great employer and i i got hired in one of the opening lines in the interview conversation is hi i am and in this particular month i going to europe but i may or may not come back you wanna continue talking he said sure let keep talking i said okay and then we continued talking so um it up in the air i told him that he gets no guarantee that i will come back and in exchange i don get health coverage while i gone to me and i okay super um my sister had gone a couple times basically took me aside and i have but one sibling and um it it fun to have a sibling because nobody is more similar to you than that sibling because they had to deal with the inanity that is your family for a long period of time but i imagine your sibling has a a similar world view perhaps in some oh my my sister particular religious and that that tends to warp her view of everything in a fashion that makes it almost diametrically opposed to mine a great many times but at the same time the pre religion understanding of something yes um hum um hum i working here uh um but working um work study so it very part time and i am full time student so i was working somewhere else before but it it was i needed somewhere on campus to be close so i didn have to drive i a senior and i just started the my art major in spring so i still have about four quarters left but i am a senior well altogether i ve been i started in ninety one that was winter ninety one and i went to columbus state and i had just there a few years that i didn go here and then so i came back so altogether i don know how many years it been but twenty seven i ll be twenty eight soon august it pretty soon i keep thinking i twenty eight now so it must be coming up may as well just get used to it wow clintonville um hum no now i live with my husband in grandview and i ve lived in all different parts of clintonville but um hum um hum except for a year and a half i lived in russia but that wasn really living ne there i was actually serving a mission for my church so southern russia it the um near um like khazakstan and i mean not really near but relatively it not close to moscow yeah it russia in the ural mountains no not i don even know that is that pretty terrible but i don think it is yeah i think it is further east than where i was i was right in the ural mountains so it like the border of europe and asia um hum it was pretty far the city actually had a million people that i lived in most of the time but it was the government that ran it actually was still um communist they weren they re not really acting they are the government there but they still it just all so messed up it doesn really matter who the it whoever wants to um it was just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they they don pay their workers and most people aren mafia so they don get paid um hum yeah this was a three years ago about three years ago in august it ll be three and yeah it was however many was that in eighty nine or ninety or something like that well it it gets more and more um like a it not like america but more and more like a regular democracy every year i mean not really but it closer and closer a little bit it wasn it wasn easy and at first it was probably a lot harder then after you ve been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things but i i took for granted coming to ameri coming back here was it was so amazing to be back in seeing all the nice things just everywhere it just i couldn believe it but now it it easy to take it for granted again just oh i back home well i was with um i mormon so we i don know if you have ever seen how they go two by two always and i was with what we call another sister i was and we would live in an apartment and we would pay for our own mission and there was a mission president and they had different people with responsibilities leaders and they would watch over you and make sure yknow call in the every night and check on you but it was really up to us what we wanted to do we were we get up leave at nine thirty and be home by nine thirty or whenever it got dark and we could do what we wanted yeah i mean we had goals certain things that like we we had a set where we like to do four hours of service every week we like teach english to little kids or or help clean or work at libraries or different things oh wow oh did you really um hum it might have been where the president lived they sometimes have like a mission home yeah especially the guys just yeah we had um any not really just modest dresses you couldn wear pants and it wou dresses couldn be ankle length they couldn be um at the knee had to be mid ca mid kn mid knee or whatever that is calf and that was certain restrictions but yeah i mean basically just modest whatever i mean i wear boots with a dress in russia i don think you do that here i think so yeah like their haircuts are a certain way and can you have to shave and um you always have to have your tie and your jacket if you can unless it really hot there di it different also depending on the climate some places you re allowed to wear sandals and right yeah right just i think it uh a to reflect the the uh um beliefs that we re trying to sh carry and and because i think if someone showed up and looking like i mean i not saying that it terrible it but if they had like a nose ring and all this stuff then it somebody might believe that they have anything credible to say and a lot of times if you re dressed more respectfully that to yknow i mean most the people will accept you if you re dressed in a dress whereas i mean even a person in a nose ring will ta will respect you but but then you re in a you re at a disadvantage if you don dress in a certain way yeah right they look at more what you have to say then your clothes and that that was something i remember them talking about too you don want them to look at what you re what you re wearing and that mostly that was a good thing for the dress code just well not really they uh have a lot of um religious beliefs on their own that they ve had held on to because um they have just have had nothing they weren even allowed to ha believe in god right so a lot of them already believe and that they have their own religion and they they re really faithful so that was the one of the main problems is that they um they had been so holding on to that for so long and it so strong they don wanna let go of what and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and so the it it was hard to talk to drunk people um hum yeah they re russian orthodox same basically same thing yeah i don even know what their holidays are i i don know um hum like cathol cathol oh from mormons well our basic um real fundamental belief is that the church that the russians believed in at one time was the true church and that it was um the the same church that christ set up when he was on the earth with the twelve apostles and and but the after christ died that the authority was taken from the earth to um have those apostles and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same catholic and ortho all the orthodox churches still carry all these beliefs watching it for a while period and then since deep space nine left i needed a little star trek fix every once and a while so i started watching it i also don have cable so ah it on and fifty three doesn come in terribly well so um i mean sometimes it like i don want kind of see what going on but um i liked it there an episode i think it was in the third season where they were stuck on an island or island it an island but a planet together i liked it there i kinda like and i figure they ll probably hook up but i don like how the show this show and this happened with deep space nine two and even with next generation for a little bit how the show become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspects of the stories don appeal to me very much um i more interested in the social things and yknow good old special effects um but i i think i like that how it kept with a sort of i tension and it not like yknow i they re not completely thrown together like uh elanna and tom which i don like that at all and it just sort of like uh whenever it comes on i roll my eyes that episode where they were stuck out in space and just if the tape can catch me rolling my eyes it oh every week i record them i yeah like files i love that no i don want them to get together i love the tension if they get together it dead whenever they get uh any of there are like five or six examples where it looks like there gonna hook up i mean that one where there like a a a the duplicate mulder well that guy who can change form that in the movie they re about to kiss and i don like it when they get that close i i like the how their per their relationship is still professional and they interact with each other on that level first and they re very good friends and they have that tension but they don succumb to it and i really like it i just dislike it a little less or dis um like it a little less or dislike it a little more when when it it looks like it gonna come to clipping someu it looks like they re it feels like they re trying to tease me as an audience and uh uh i that not something i feel peased by particularly uh which one are you talk yeah it felt innocent to me and i liked that um because all the other times where they started to kiss it always been like stereotypical romantic da da da da da and that like wow two friends alone it new years perfect yknow it wasn it wasn like they were gonna jump in the sack or anything like that it was just so i didn object to that one at all um hum um i feel that the past season the past two seasons really haven been as strong as the earlier seasons and so in some ways i yknow i i not as upset about the files completing it run as i have been about other shows i mean it also the simpsons final season i ve heard ah i ve heard it it hasn been as i i i ve heard it from less reputable sources so yeah yeah i love that show i ve nearly every episode on tape but this past this past season i ve i ve been really disappointed with the simpsons yeah wid yeah been highly critical of of organized religion yeah yeah yeah i mean i i think that the stories haven been ah i i mean i some of my favorite like lines from the simpsons is where there highly critical one of my favorites is uh when bart the one with where bart thinks he loses his soul which in some ways is kinda preachy um cause i mean like lisa takes other positions like ya whether the soul is is real it doesn matter da da da da da but i love it one scene while they re cleaning out the uh well bart and are being punished they re cleaning out the pipes of the organs and the the pipes of the organ and uh like bart like there no such thing as a soul milhouse is like why would they lie to us what would they have to gain and then they it cuts to uh revel reverend lovejoy emptying the uh uh uh what are they uh the the tip jars the the donation thing into a little change counting machine like i don hear cleaning what would they have to gain um oh yeah yeah it like what religion are you oh that one it has all those those great rules that don work out in real life christianity yeah you re happy and you know it clap your hands yeah i i like that aspect i mean i don know i don pay attention to who the writers are um so maybe the writing has changed south pacific yeah yeah gambling yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it just a lot of the one this season to me have just been disappointing the i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off i mean the the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season is just it been completely outrageous story lines and like the jokes aren as integrated into the story i mean there ll be there seems to me there more one liners so i a little disappointed i sad that the show going off the th the show gonna stop but i not as sad because the product i getting now it with the simpsons having it being replaced by futurama which ah i find to be absolute genius so it not so bad it files i sad but not as sad based on the past couple seasons when deep space nine went off the the air that one really bothered me and they even had a star trek replacement still on but uh i don know um kinda yknow we know but it th what i ve liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it not right and that it wrong i mean there was the episode and socially too i mean mostly a and kids are emotionally immature as well so like the songs that their friends are listening to and their friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they re still acting like a fifth grader yknow their not interested in girls and they re still listening to music that younger kids would like they re just generally they mature a little slower takes them longer to catch up attention deficit hyperactive disorder well actually you can have well they mainly usually go together some kids have learning disabilities without the a and some have a without the learning disability and some have both and you can have a without having the hyperactive part you can have attention deficit disorder with what they call hypo activity and that the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they re kind of like out of touch with reality and they are always looking out the window and like they re the one that says i didn hear what what was the question and uh they re they re a and they can quite focus and sh distract ne they can screen out the distractions but because they re not hyper they re not always doing this and they re not bothering people they re kind of the they re the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle those are the kids that are real cooperative and they re always smiling they re kind of spaced out and daydreaming and and takes a long time to realize hey this kid can focus but with the kid that all over the place and doing a tapping this kids chair and the kid goes make him stop tapping my chair yi you can see right away that he can focus because when you re he asks you for help and you come over to explain something to him and he like all over the place while you re explaining he not listening you trying to show him something he won look at it yknow it like people often say a kids can focus or can attend to anything but what really happening is they attend to everything they can they just can single out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything we equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffling his papers this kid back up his pencil and so they get a little bit of everything and they don learn anything you see oh or um if you read it to yourself out loud like if you re in a room by yourself and you read out loud do you remember it better than if you read silently if you hear yourself say the words well you have to um try some different things like put on headphones with music that doesn have any words and try to read somewhere like yeah that blocks out all that uh sound extraneous stuff that trying to pull you away yeah yeah and you don want to listen to any music with words because then you ll start singing in the words and then you won be able to read now how can you do that yeah and i have kids that say i do better when i listen to my music honest i do misses please let me listen to my headphones but then they can hear you when you say okay the time up stop now or whatever you re going poke him so i don usually let the kids listen to their headphones oh maybe the last week of school in june or something but or maybe right around christmas time but most of the time i don because they get too out of touch with everything that going on in the room and i don have a like a regular size class like i ll have five six seven kids at a time and believe me when you got seven hyper active in your room it just like forty of any other kind it plenty yeah oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that shouldn be but um i think that the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we frefer kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they won just give this kid a pill if he doesn have eight out of the twelve symptoms or whatever so we refer them to those doctors and then if this do those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it usually just for the school day not during the summer not over vacation not after five clock not on the weekends and it just to help them focus and then these doctors also ask for reports back from the teachers and if you don see any appreciable difference in two or three weeks then you take the kid off and you try something else and some kids medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in observe the kid you can believe it the same kid other kids doesn phase them they might as well be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they stunt your growth and they subdue your appetite and some of the other yknow some kids get headaches from dexadrine and aderal so i say yknow if it works use it if it if it doesn work just forget it but yknow a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because there may be just not able to pay attention a little bit but they re not really a and the parents are taking them in and going johnnie not getting straight a put him on something so i guess yeah an i think it really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids don like being on medication because it makes them different they don look at it like gee i really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look it like well none of my friends have to do it so why do i have to do it yknow they look at it like it a big pain because they gotta run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and generally the long acting they re time released ones there only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time release and it wears off and it doesn do what it supposed to so they go back to the six hour dosage yknow one in the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they re late to the lunch line and yknow they just hate it so but it isn something they can a lot of kids will not i guess they re in denial just like we would be they say it doesn help me i don need it but when you sit down and say okay what are the things you re able to do when you re on it that you really have trouble with when you re off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yeah i did get better grades last nine weeks didn i wow isn that amazing you were taking your pills then some connection here so you kind of just have to sit them down and and say well let just go through some of the things that give you trouble and we ll write them down and say oh well last nine weeks you did that without any problem at all this nine weeks you haven been able to focus on that maybe the does help you some maybe you just yknow not giving it credit by the eighth grade they are sixth and seventh graders pretty much know everything and you re the stupid one but by the time they get to eighth grade they re going oh you re the best teacher i can believe i said that to you or they yeah they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school three years i have them usually i have them sixth seventh and eighth for those language arts subjects unless they get some miraculous cure and they get phased out like right now i phasing a kid an eighth grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and he very bright and he still a terrible speller but he is not lazy and he does his assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what he supposed to do and he a good writer and usually when he misspells something you can figure out what it says from the context yknow so we re in the process of phasing him out so that he won have to he had help i think since he was in kindergarten that the other thing that really an enigma about these kids ninety percent of the time their i is like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty and i mean they re very bright but yet something isn connecting some wires are crossed up here or something and they re a and a and so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people ve been saying um hum yeah i yeah like i said i don know i i just i got to make some decisions here yknow uh i don want to put too much pressure on it yknow one of the elders told me hey yknow cut yourself some slack and just relax for awhile yknow because i worked in a movie theatre for a year and yknow i got hassled and about my hair yknow uh told me the only thing keeping me from moving up in the company was a pair of scissors yknow and i just told him well it has to do with my belief system so you re in violation of the first amendment yknow and then they realized that i wasn stupid so yknow they just made things more and more difficult for me yknow so i just decided to since they weren gonna change i was just gonna leave yknow but so it yknow it it a hard you choose uh if you re not idealistic person it i mean just more so me i i don like i said i don try and dwell on the negative yknow but uh it very easy to get sucked in to what wrong out there and it also very easy to get sucked into the attitude well i gonna change this you know if you you do what you can do as a human being that alone is good enough and and that what a lot of people are telling me yknow just yknow life a struggle anyway yknow so just simply living yknow for me getting out of bed is is a victory yknow for the longest time i was so depressed yknow but the animals you know yeah using the animals uh uh for therapy animal therapy um i mean dogs in particular cats um but know there uh there some animals that aren to be pets yknow um they re wild animals yknow and yeah i saw a show last week on fox that was called when good pets go bad too and none of the animals they profiled were pets i mean a thirty six foot long python what the hell a person doing with that as a pet they shouldn be allowed to and then people treating a buffalo like they could stand next to it and take a family picture doesn show any knowledge or respect to the animal that a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out my opinion when that stuff happens when i see when i see someone light the horns of a bull on fire in spain and torment the bull and then all of a sudden the bull gets the flames put out and the bull runs his gourd through the person leg and throws him around and kicks him right near death i don have any sympathy for him oh i not shocked to the bad behavior of the anima i don consider it justice well i mean well the humans that started it and the man narrating the thing said there wasn a single animal that they profiled in the thing that uh um behaved the way it did on it own accord it behaved that way as a result of the way it was being treated by human beings so i mean there a i mean yeah the animal therapy is very good thing my dog has been very um supportive been very you know like you said the unconditional love part yknow i mean how you could you could you could leave for a week and come back and they re they re like ok i glad you re back yknow none of this where have you been shit as long as you uh see and i already i already suspected knew i was gonna be getting a notice so because i flunked out like in december yknow and uh so in january i had already contacted the navy and the airforce uh about getting into their taking their tests and everything taking their uh physicals uh so um hum right um hum well then they had uh after that they had the lottery number and that wasn if you were hot yknow if you got your number was picked i mean i don know which would be worse knowing that you re gonna get a notice and being able to prepare for it or uh because i ve had friends that got nu uh numbers and everything yknow and and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my god so um hum uh huh i was reading a thing though in uh the a i think it was yesterday where uh your uh minority and your your uh uh majority yknow uh it always been that well yknow they were trying to make it seem like it different it always but like yknow like the army has always been forty percent uh minority and sixty percent or something like that yknow that uh airforce has always been uh like seventy thirty or something like that yknow because the standards are a little bit higher to get in and a lot of people don want to get into that yknow they don want to take them tests and everything yknow uh my uh a cousin that was a uh spent twenty five years i think in the army because that he could ve done better but that all he wanted to yknow be a drill sergeant and stuff like that yknow but uh i i i just think a lot lot of times the media uh and research and stuff like that to do a lot of things that were done years ago um hum um hum um hum um hum they always been there i mean yknow and uh i don really care what the uh guys specific thing is if he in a fox hole with me yknow and as long as he can shoot a gun yknow i mean i could care le i ve got gay friends yknow so i think it better probably at the don let them say anything about it yknow and most of the people will yknow like when you get to a i lived in the barracks a lot of time but i mean yknow lot of people yknow they get their own places off base yknow and who cares what they are i mean i don care yknow like say i have friends gay friends that yknow and i don care what they do i mean if they old enough to do whatever the heck they want to do yknow um hum um hum um hum yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh yknow the parenting and everything yknow there was something missing in the uh uh the child life yknow uh uh i bet he wasn getting perhaps attention uh those kids in particular i don understand how they could be building bombs in in their basement and mom and dad not know what was going on yknow i mean uh it just tragedy i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i don know uh eleven years old or something like that well an accidental shooting him in him and the uh another friend of mine from the same same class yknow um he pulled a gun and shot him yknow and didn know that the damn thing was loaded but and they were talking about another thing about that yknow where some kid i guess that happened just here in town uh couple about a week ago or something like that yknow where a guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really yknow and who really to fault and who really at who guilty i don know uh i like to have uh not that they ever would have but if if one of the two that you that culombine yknow if they would have survived i like to seen what was going through their heads yknow but that something we ll never know um hum um hum but that kind of it it yknow kind of came through where they were like uh when i was growing up we had the uh the yknow you had your jocks and everything of course and you had your uh we called we were called deads yknow uh and i was kind of like in the middle yknow of it i played a little bit of sport yknow but i also associated with them and they were basically potheads yknow and everything so uh so like i say i but yknow i was kind of uh associated with both of them but then the football players yknow some of them were uh pretty uh pretty much asses yknow no other way to put it especially if they were got scholarships and stuff yknow they were mean they could be real uh nasty but uh i just can see i don know i just think maybe i don know looking at it back is like uh well i ve got into arguments with a few of them and then seen them later on yknow and it like hey man yknow let me buy you beer yknow or whatever yknow sorry about what happened we were yknow shoot it happened five years ago yknow i don i try to forget things that yknow i mean my mind got enough to absorb yknow without worrying about uh which i do worry quite a bit about things but uh about stupid stuff uh like that kind of yknow somebody gets mad at you because you were a your a not a jock or yknow you re you re a you re a you re a this or you re a that yknow everybody trying to label people and stuff yeah and a and everybody gonna associate with people that they feel comfortable with so yknow and unfortunately as that guy this guy in particular he was a center for the football team as he grew up older yknow uh he realized that he wasn as big as important as he uh and he blew out his knee for a yknow i went to i went to school with larry hunter who the a basketball coach for uh now and uh and he had the same thing happen to him uh he had uh scholarship for and both of his knees are shot and everything but uh and he was a good ballplayer probably one best ones i ever seen and uh rivalled like a larry byrd yknow back in that day and everything and uh but one heck of a nice guy yknow never let it get to him never thought he was any better than anybody else yknow he was always there to to help out every kid yknow but then some people like you say yknow some people aren that way um hum um hum they had one i was uh just heard on news this morning they were talking about some guy who like seventy seven years old for kenyon college or something the was throwing erasers at ever yeah but i could i could imagine um hum um hum um hum yeah but yknow the th if you hit somebody in the eye obviously it gonna hurt him but yknow most could see it they they could be ducking i mean yknow you seventy seven years old i can imagine being hurt by him yknow um hum um hum uh uh uh uh okay yes pets are okay i was born in dayton ohio i lived there almost thirty five years before moving to columbus in nineteen eighty one uh lived in uh north west columbus for eighteen years uh moved last january a little farther west about five miles further west near hilliard but still live in the city of columbus uh so i ve been here about eighteen nineteen years i like columbus also i think it a great city although the last three months i ve threatened to move on more than one occasion because of all the traffic congestion and all of the road construction you just can get anywhere it very frustrating uh but other than that columbus is a great city um i went to this is something different about me most people don know that uh it it existed in the the twentieth century but i went to an all girl catholic school for twelve years uh so there were there were no boys and i wasn in a classroom with boys until i got to college uh i went to college at wright state university uh my parents couldn afford to send me so i had to work two years in high school two years after high school to pay my way through college um taught school for about eight and a half nine years and during that time got my masters degree in remedial reading um taught for i think i said this about eight and a half nine years and my life and career took a whole different turn and became president of my teachers association or teachers union and that led to a job in political action because i always been active in politics from high school on uh the first campaign i worked in was for john kennedy in nineteen sixty i was a freshman in high school and continued working in campaigns in a volunteer status uh several different campaigns in ohio and in dayton where i came from uh but moved to columbus to take a job as a political action consultant for the largest public employee union did that for a couple of years till i went out in the field and negotiated labor contracts um did that that kind of stressful um um so i decided to strike off on my own and try some public relations and marketing and did that and um i didn never been married didn plan that that wasn a goal in life it just never uh so i have no kids but i have a pet and now i uh i call myself semi retired i get a small um yknow monthly retirement and then i supplement my income by doing things like this i an independent contractor i do training i do um different things yknow where people get my opinion i ve done a couple of the um things with uh lawyers looking yknow they do like mock trials on real issues and then you listen to all of the stuff and then you yknow pretend that you re a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case going to going into court so that fun so that a little bit about me uh lets see my family my mom and dad um well i i uh my mother was first generation american my grandparents came to this country from hungary and that was a neat experience i liked growing up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant in hungary uh and he thought this was the greatest country in the world and that rubbed off on me i still do also he always voted so yknow i learned at an early age that it important to vote um my mom and dad were both alcoholics um i have two brothers no sisters one older than me one younger than me um and i have no children but i have a pet that is my child and i always say pets are uh children you raise pets you spoil so my my pet is very spoiled that right that it a parakeet a parakeet yes little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff oh yeah oh wow yeah um hum i had that with uh the parakeet i had before their lifespan in the wild is about five years seven years in captivity and he was thirteen yeah um hum right the hardest bo both the hardest and easiest thing i think i ve ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him euthanized um hum yeah hum right you know you have to you know you don have a choice but at the same time you duh don right you don want them to suffer but you want to keep them but it is whoops oops i hope i didn move put my hand here try to keep it out the line of the wire yeah no problem yes um hum um hum right right um hum me too yeah i really don know i don understand why they don because to me it the most important freedom we have and people um bitch and complain all the time but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you don because your voice wasn heard um when i was a political action consultant for the ohio education association i used to go around try to get teachers involved in politics um and one of the things i would tell them is that every vote is important john kennedy won if if if you would take all of the the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation by one vote per pers per precinct one vote per precinct yknow if there had just been one additional vote either way in any of those precincts yknow he would have lost uh and so one vote does count and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven eighteen nineteen votes um if i knew the magic reason why people don vote i could sell that and make a make a fortune um but i don know what it is when i did school levy campaigns uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school levy get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i do is register parents because many of them don vote uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country doesn even begin to vote until they re forty if i had known that when i was in college and worked so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i couldn vote till i was twenty one and i was upset yknow because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i couldn uh i had to wait till i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that yknow worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed if i known that they weren gonna vote at eighteen and they were gonna wait until they were almost forty i wouldn of i wouldn of wasted my time um but anyway um you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade age a lot of people switch from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the party animal go out and have fun person just the number of people that were here brother brother jed yeah um i talk to him every now and then yeah yeah i think every college does um i a lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell is opposing my beliefs so i stand there and pretty much spar with him about it he usually ends up getting frustrated and tells me to leave well he told a jewish friend of mine that her grandparents that died in the holocaust went to hell because they were jewish yeah he says a lot of racial slurs like that he really homophobic where i don know lutheran is a little bit more open to homosexuality i guess just pretty much that if you ask for forgiveness forgiveness is granted whatever um doesn just because you sin doesn mean you re going to and pretty much stuff like and he try to quote the bible and i have a bible there with me and i look it up and it wouldn it wouldn be right at all yeah yeah well when he telling my friends that their grandparents went to hell because they re of a different religion that pretty extreme yeah um i ve grown up here all my life so it really hasn shocked me all that yeah i had about three or four friends that were actually gay it wasn a huge shock it wasn my first encounter with homosexuality if they wanna get married that their business i don think mine or anyone else to say that they can they re normal people just outside of their sexual well majority of the people prefer heterosexual relations but they re normal people outside of they re homosexuality i mean it nothing different than regular parents i really am not educated in that at all so i wouldn probably say anything since i ignorant in the field um hum yeah he uses a lot different slurs towards gay people yeah i remember political correctness changing the words doesn change how someone feels about something i don think its made us any better or any it just change the language i don think so not with the diversity that we have here i mean if we were that racist of a city then we wouldn be that accepting to gay pride and the black out that we had on campus a few weeks back with the double a i really don think we re incredibly racist i mean i sure there is some but it not as extreme as some places that i ve been birmingham alabama yeah um when i went i went with my friend and we were staying at his grandpa and his grandpa would sit on the back porch say all kinds of racial slurs towards black and everyone would be all right with that um hum i think so i mean there enough open minded people in the country that i think that we would be ready i mean colin powell was pretty close if he would have ran yeah i say it not any different than having a man i mean it a person she just have a different way of going about it clipping probably i say probably the black man yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i think simply it not too much of a change from the status quo i was too young no all of his problems have personal problems that really shouldn have been touched on except the media got into it and um i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they weren that shocked that a president would do something like that and then they physically died before they got a chance to live and when their spirit wakes up and finds out that they re physically dead and they can do anything in a physical world anymore they want to draw themselves to especially if they were a bad person word they want to draw them to the brightest thing which are children of light and as the way i put it it kind of new agey and i don like new agey stuff but yknow it best example is moths from the dark when you flip on a light the moths will go right to it a child like that a young man like that is very impressionable very young still and uh these bad spirits will be flocked right to him um so when he did that though i mean there medication out there that can help people like i said i don wanna see people with brain injury with mental illness or with any kind of disability use that as an excuse for their behavior because if they were an asshole before their brain injury they re gonna be an asshole after their brain injury five times um it magnified they have that choice they can say well listen you don understand and blah blah blah now i ve tried that but the best i can do now is try and advocate for myself in terms of listen uh i hear what you re saying but i trying to show you that uh and tell you how i work best so as long as you can try not to dictate to me and allow me some freedom and give me goals of what you want accomplished and give me the freedom to accomplish them the way that i can do it um not by quotas and deadlines and crap like that um i can show you what to do and that that the struggle i having right now i trying to find employment where people will cut me some slack yknow and i wanted to do some driving but yknow uh because at least out on the road yknow i don have to put up with anyone crap but long driving long distances is not good for me focusing and concentrating um and i i ve had yknow several accidents several tickets um so i mean i ve even had uh yknow two other head injuries as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean it ju yeah i mean when i when you come down to these things there uh people with mental illness and with a disability are trying to pawn off their responsibility onto everybody but themselves yknow well the medical doctors if they would of seen this guy and given him medication he wouldn of went out there and killed somebody yknow shoulda would have could have man if the guy stopped taking his medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take that medicine every day just like it mine take mine every day and when i stop taking mine that was my responsibility which is why i don wanna go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there a there a some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract that they wouldn be liable and i saying i could take that route but it it would cost me a lot of money that i don have to get the legal defense and it be just best for me to take the responsibility like i have and i sold the car that i had to my sister uh i going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed a lease for uh but i gonna make them come after me i mean uh i already went to court once and and uh ev well i even wi even with the evidence being in my favor i mean i was only at this place three months i didn do any damage to it um and the walls did not need painted i wasn there long enough to make them dirty uh but um their own person even went through on a first run through after i moved out and my mother and i cleaned that thing spotless top bottom bathrooms and washed the floors and mopped the floors and everything and uh their own person came through an said it rated the paint an a which meant according to their system a meant no no painting was needed uh well then then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh yknow get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and they uh scratched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating um and even though that evidence was in front of a magistrate and he could see uh i assume he educated and not stupid otherwise he wouldn be a magistrate could see that that person did that and it was suspect ah he still ruled in their favor so i not gonna get any fairness or justice out of that but uh so they sent me the award saying that they decided in their favor and all that crap well yknow fine uh but i not gonna not gonna pay them till they contact me again or take me to court again yknow they got the money i don um um hum um hum um hum well i thought about that yknow i mean doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um there a lot of uh i don know how how the training is done with some of these animals yknow some of them are treated very cruelly to get them to do what they do to even to help like blind people um help people that have other physical disabilities um you can tell from the way the in terms of uh with with the the way the dog behaves with the person that has the disability uh that they been trained for um you can tell whether they ve been tre trained the right way or whatever so i thought about that but yknow um yknow i haven given it much more then yknow just the thought but yknow i looked in the veterinary assistant i went in there and it wasn uh yknow i was there just for a half a day and yknow they were telling me about some of these people out there uh yknow i don understand the law again but yknow there people out there that will go out and will buy a dog yknow nice dog and uh because they don wanna make the time to train it and spend the time with it because they take a lot of time and discipline and love and care just like a child um they more less buy a dog for a token yknow uh a chick magnet yknow a conversation piece or some kind of trophy well here my here my dog my ah yeah full and uh a lot of these people were uh the dogs were reacting in a they were objective yknow and they because they weren being paid attention to and they were pissing on the carpet and making messes and chewing things up and and these people would bring them in and uh uh have them put to sleep and i couldn be part of a veterinary practice that uh did that and unfortunately they have to do what the people with the pets say but it just i couldn be around that and yknow i would go off on people that would do that bring that in i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth ah i not a violent man either even as big as i am yknow yknow yeah up on bethel road that um hum um hum that how i feel that that what i belie i choose to believe that oh wo yeah it is no no no it not you can do whatever you want there uh i ve heard conferences where the um i ve heard the prophet talk about how you should keep in touch with the people that you served and or the people that you worked with and that you knew and and that they even if they can re you can remember how to speak just try and send them a le letter i ve been really ba about that so i feel a lot of pressure to i need to i mean it not i i just don wanna lose contact with them because you get these great friendships and but yeah you can there i know people that have married people from their i mean that really not supposed to happen while you re on your mission but when you yknow when you re done if you wanna go back um is that happens too but it really not looked i mean you shouldn that against the rules on the mission um if the people wanna get married when they get home that fine but um yeah that it it another thing where you re focused trying focus on your work and you re not allowed to date never alone so and um but you can live where you ve served you can do whatever you want after you re done okay i actually joined the church in uh well i don know it was six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at and they were um just asking people if they thought that christ had visited america and there was a record of that account if do i think that would be important and i was like well i think so yeah and but i didn i was kinda hesitant i mean it took me a while to i read the book of mormon i really prayed about it and took me about six months and and then i finally decided that i really liked liked it and it was what i had been wanting so so that how i decided um hum no i don think it was because i grew up just basic not even really christian just really not no real religion and i been going to pre presbyterian church as i was about nineteen years old looking for something a church i just had a feeling that i wanted to have that in my life because i never had that before and so i was just looking around and i was open to anything i had listened to eastern religions and i ve listened to the jehovah witnesses and and and then when i read in the book of mormon it just i it a feeling of like like i felt like i had heard it before and it made sense to me and and so that why i really felt at home with this and that why i decided no i never did i i don know of many people that do but but it was also for me i think if i know something true i just know it and then as long as it keeps on being true over and over again if it not just some exciting thing that for one day oh this is great but like six months later it still has the same still ringing true a year later two years later then that how i feel um hum i read it yeah i do i and and if i read it every i try to and um and i we go to church i have all sorts of activities that i do and i just a always feeling like i reinforced that it not just some sort of flaky idea that it for me that it um real and and it it just a always makes sense that important to me that i feel like it makes sense um hum yeah yes it does definitely he went on a mission to texas and he he been back for a while he thirty two well he ll be thirty two in april probably it is you re right i i asked him what language did he have to to learn to yeah no he didn either he joined when he was sixteen and he was catholic before and similar just kind of thing with him just having meeting the missionaries and um hum yeah we met um at where we there a singles ward where we call ward it on twelfth avenue down here and it just where all the single people under thirty go to church and there dances and different activities and um hum it at it at the same building actually it it it used for different things yeah um hum it kind of frustrating but i i it a go it probably good for me because i so it hard for me to just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want to yknow i just want to convince them but i can do that so it a good exercise for me i look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and um hum but there things that are difficult like there the where we go we we have a temple too and they can go in the temple well they can but they have to fit fit certain criteria they have to be baptized and not and follow all these health codes and all the different codes and but that not what they re interested in doing and and that hard i think and like going on a mission really they didn understand that they re my dad was like do they know how small you are they re sending you to siberia so they didn know no they thought it was my dad told me later that thought i was getting sent off and just by myself yknow yeah more like that right yeah right real war that all right mm um hum i think his mom was pretty yknow doesn really talk about it wanna talk about it he comes from his his real biological family is very um i don know if guess you call it dysfunctional or they re um he didn live with them after he was fourteen or so his it was just so bad that his mom couldn take care of him and his his siblings so he was pretty much on his oh own but he was taken in by a family that was members of the mormon church and so mm basically they didn legally adopt him or anything but they re the ones that he considers his family really and i mean he still keeps in contact with his mom and his dad but it always kind of a they re just her she was drinking i mean terrible alcoholic and very his ma his father was very abusive and they didn weren even married that he remembers he remembers the stepfathers and and that kind of thing it just not good no it was his mom ran away is what happened yeah his mom couldn take care of him anymore and he was like i think he was about fourteen and he just he didn have really anywhere to go and luckily these families had taken his different siblings different families took them i don know how they got connected with the church because it was all church families that took care of them but um it was good for him because he got that example and so i don know if there any particular i think if someone knows if anyone knew of something like that going on they would that about right that about right think it cro co trosser cross cross dressing uh huh or cross personality homosexual oh okay gay whatever term ser aids well i see i gonna have to fall way back and show my age again as most people would say uh i i would really like to see to happen but i also know that it most it ll never happen within the next three or four generations but i st i of a who still believes that the lady has a place in her home and i do not believe that we need a man and wife out working and making incomes as everyone in the united states today feels they must uh hazel hit upon it rather lightly a while ago and was talking about need versus uh luxuries i want i want i want well i uh my judgment is that we re spending today probably eighty percent of uh the income on things that they want and only twenty percent on what they need and that all they need to spend on that need so therefore the nec pardon today society does describe the need entirely differently than what i would talking talking to this gentleman last night we got back and we were comparing uh our uh uh early life uh we didn even know what a nickel or a dime was uh those tha that was unimportant and we also were talking about how uh how we uh went he was telling me a little bit about it and i said let me stop you paul i said paul wh what kind of shoes did you wear uh in the summer he said we didn wear any shoes aha and then i told him how we didn either i came from a very large family uh mostly boys we would uh take our sho shoes off as soon as the ear ear as we could in the springtime we would uh store them in tallow in jars of tallow tallow is uh lamb lard if if you want to call it and that was a preservative and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as november this year it would ve been november we would take those shoes out and depending upon whose foot fit those shoes those would the be the person who wore them it wouldn be th the the the one who had worn them in the spring cause he growing in the meantime and uh and it may go to another another and i can remember we passed shoes down as many as four of we children now my dad also repaired shoes he repaired shoes he cut our hair well today that would be the most horrible thing is some of the kids that well i need me a pair of kw um i don know whether you want ri uh advertising on here or not but it not a i i want a nike or i want a rocky or i want a guess uh those that pure luxury no needs at all but uh today society i started the school year off with uh twenty seven kindergarteners and no aid and they were just wild yknow i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and didn know from day to day yknow whether was gonna keep it i finally had to say i cant do this twenty seven kindergarteners i sorry i can do this by the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital those things happen yeah they had to gr and they just called me on the phone not knowing yknow just that she went to the hospital well they said to me will you stay well i said yes but then a a when it got in to two weeks and i wasn getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it like i sorry i a substitute su substitute i getting sixty dollars a day i can do this unless yknow i have more help and i just flatly said that i sorry i mean if i a if it was my own job i would have struggled with it but it was not my own job and i didn know what was gonna happen so if they would ve gotten some help in there for me i would have stayed perhaps but no i i you know you can work for under pay and under staff and you just can do everything so a computer calls you yeah uh uh you talk to a computer always you deal with a computer um hum um hum uh they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you don want to do it mo most usually i just put location i don want to go certain places uh well like a miles down to the south end or something like that but you just punch in your numbers always you just talk with numbers uh huh yeah um hum oh really where are you from um hum i i did i hm what different i my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so th that from that angle was i mean still is my elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it there a block away olentangy village i right in where i always was i mean i i was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a fell full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know compared to any other cities course i i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years um um i was at eugene and i wasn even in it was hundred thousand yknow and uh i loved that but i then i came back and i live in olentangy village which is right on the river and it very uh very scenic very beautiful oh oh did you come in uh huh it kind of an neat place isn it uh huh it got yeah and uh well she star the th uh the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it been like that it was the first apartment community um in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess uh huh uh huh and that what i like about it is the ambience and the the river and the oh oh and the apartments are just very very plain and but uh it it is it is it a it kind of a oasis in the middle of the city so uh no the only thing that was really down there before i moved out was the leveque tower the shortest one uh but of course the university is just about the same in some ways the stadium and all that it better in terms of the arts and there all kinds of things going on i mean you could if you had the money you could do something every it aren really saying much new where if they have a more compact time they could be so i like to see them see the time reduced the conventions used to be interesting because they debated the platforms and that all settled now and it just sort of a yknow the celebration type stuff well that not interesting well they couldn change and move the primaries like to may well that it competition to be earliest and the st the federal government trying to stay stay out of the state face and so again that another one of those things that just live with it i mean there enough of there enough things to do and fight in were it life but that not worth it ya know that probably what i ll do ignore it ti till un untill till like august or july and then start paying attention yeah wait right the amount of money that is spend is just i could just can imagine uh ya know millions and millions have been spent already hundreds millions and it just starting my background what do mean yeah i grew up in columbus i was born here uh went to went and here at at sch for school as an undergrad yeah i went to columbus public schools uh didn yeah um um always over on the west side same area of town always lived there since live there now um came up here to um got my bachelors in uh english lit and then went to case western reserve for a masters then i decided i wanted to go somewhere else in the country after i got my library degree and the only job i could find was here in it was a ti tight was real tight job market for librarians then hell yeah well it good now uh well the web again has changed that there computers have made a big difference uh it more exciting now for people who in that area um who are interested in it more emphasis on information not books and things a going to the library it getting the infor making information available so it i think it attracting a different group of people and it it more interesting um but it was real tough job market then so i ended up at the state library downtown worked there for five years and decided i ha wasn anything else there for me uh and got a job at this company which was still relatively new there were like hundred hundred and fifty employees was in seventy eight um and then i ve just i have stayed there and it grown a lot and the work changes it an interesting place to work because uh well first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening we re trying to stay out in front of what in front of what library innovations in front of web and net innervations and trying to incorporate it all so it it ya know it kind of exciting because you re i getting in on things that are really new and trying to master it the project i working on now um it trying to find a way to automatic to create data that describes web resources so that libraries can take this data and put it in their catalog and integrate it with the regular collection and we re doing a lot of with a yeah it is it pretty it pretty neat project a lot of new things who at uh java and the web give us opportunities do things that we ve talked about before but couldn really do very well so it pretty neat yeah well we didn even have computers at our desks we had terminals that connected to a system yeah yeah it was uh and ya know you and isn very ya know it was very slow and and key in a few characters and send it and wait and much different now very different uh just been a lot of innovations and mm hmm my first job over here at the main library was key punching for the system they have now key punching the old card data into that that was my first first library job i started at the real bottom of it yeah and i don rea uh it yeah you just sit at the computer and key the data in or well the system we re doing now is you can put in like um the address the for a web resource it goes out and extracts data analyzes what there and comes up with ya know subject terminology and call numbers and presents it back to you and then you can edit and do whatever you want with it so ya know it it doing some of that some of that the automatic assigning and subject headings and call numbers that that a lot of re we re doing a lot of research on that it got a ways to go it getting better um it i mean it a lot better than it was even a year ago uh well we put all kinds of information out on our own website which there so much it very hard to find what you want ya know it that a constant problem with information is the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want but if you can get to it if it not out there you can find it uh it it a problem for us and for libraries because there just a barrage of what they re getting and it not just from us it from the literature uh there literally do ya know hundreds of library publications uh and it a problem that librarians are facing all the time they can keep up there too much information and too much change uh librarians se and this is against probably of the image of librarians are they re very very eager to embrace change uh internet came out and ya know and when it and when it got out of the area that was being used by universities or whatever for research that what it was at first librarians were right there they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they could do with it um when we didn you know it was revolutionary when we announced we were gonna use i for access to the system and we provide you software you can do some of the work that you used to doing but with us in your computer and it like it was incredible that i mean we had trouble with the demand it was ya know like triple what we expected librarians were ready for it yeah make their job earlier and faster uh ya know and librarian librarians libraries like so many other places especially at universities or they ve seen budget problems and the subscriptions for seriou periodicals are just outrageous some of those triple every year yeah yeah they do well that what that what they ve done well they ve done that here too they ve done every university well right but the ones that are raising are the ones that are the standards in the fields but right and but more and more those are also available on the web but you have to subscribe to them so it still and institutional subscription i mean that a constant problem for the serials people everywhere i mean just it incredible what happened with the costs ya know i mean i ve seen articles that say some of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year but if you do that to ten things it some but it in integral to the university collection that really hits your budget ya know and then there always the professor who wants a particular journal because they like it that you really didn need because then you could get more bang for your bucks yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we do a lot of inter library loan too that it oh okay that was easy yeah it was easy yeah it was yeah it was interesting i usually don have trouble talki yeah it was because i got it was because i got into a different i mean i had grown up with these people yknow i hung out with all these people that were part of my youth group and and i hung out with them and hung out with them and and i came to columbus and met a whole new group of people mean every year i ve been down here i ve met another yknow thousand people and they re all different every year they re all different people and that didn happen back home i keep meeting people and it just really fascinating yeah this is endless flow of people and you re like wow and man there get some weird looking people down here man there some good looking chicks down here in columbus let me tell you um yeah my freshman year i went out with uh someone her name was she um she the one who really got me into the uh what we call charismatic um christianity the christianity uh yknow like the opposite of charismatic is the um the serious old time protestant church where they put numbers up on the wall and you open up your hymnal to those numbers you sing you stand up when everyone tells you stand up you sit down when everyone tells you to sit down yadda yadda and then the protestant the uh sorry the um charismatic is the exact opposite of that when you think of charismatic you think of the black churches where there all sorts of organ playing and yknow praise the praise the and hands in the air and singing and dancing and people falling over and and she she really introduced me to that um and then we dated for about three months and i both of us decided okay this is we accomplished what we were supposed to accomplish in this relationship you ve introduced me to something and i ve introduced you to something and now we re gonna go our separate ways and so we separated and then i found my current church and got plugged in there and i met someone there um in january of this year we dated for two months and then i got really tired of the fact that within two weeks of knowing me and dating me she said william you re the person i gonna marry and that flipped me out that flipped me out man i couldn handle that that i not ready for that i mean that was crazy she was twenty three first person i ve ever dated that older than me and uh that was just frightening i mean she was like dead serious she was a hundred percent sure i was the person she was going to marry and i ll see her at church every so often and she ll come up and give me a big hug she like i miss you i like well i miss you too not probably the way you miss me but i miss i miss you yknow um yeah if she a no no no no no no i mean she a she a great person she a good christian but there some things about her that i would not want in a wife ixnay on that but um i ve been single since uh probably march and i probably gonna stay that way for a while mainly because i don like anybody nobody likes me i like it that way i don i don have money and when i start dating people i have expre i have extremely expensive tastes for women and i like wine and dining people i love the opera and that gets real expensive a while gets real expensive after a while uh i taking one class i taking uh an accounting class i had a real big mess academically um graduated high school with three five it was all college prep classes a courses i got a really high i extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coasting on that intellect i go in take an exam bing bang go out get an a wouldn even study for it i think i studied as much my senior year as i did my freshman year for one midterm or or one final and uh that just didn work when i got to college but i didn know that until i was done with my freshman year with a one point seven a about uh about whe see the middle of winter quarter i realized why i was in engineering i had applied three colleges my senior year of high school ohio state on a whim from my dad who told me to apply there because i could get in without any trouble whatsoever naval academy and the air force academy now naval academy air force academy and west point are three of the top har ten hardest schools in the world to get into you get into one of those academies and you re coming out as an engineer that what they all are i mean yeah there other there other field but the vast majority are engineers i like math and science so i figure oh engineering i don have any other options i must be engineering so i came to college and i got into the honors engineering freshman freshman honginineer honors honors engineering program called the gateway program engineering is the hardest field to study aside probably from law or medicine and i went into the honors program that was a big mistake really really big mistake i got to college and it just went downhill i had all that freedom and i had no clue how to study and it just went to hell in a hand basket summer um summer spring quarter i switched my major to music because i extremely musically inclined it one of the gifts that i ve gotten and um that uh that i discovered is very similar to acting which i love to do but i realized that just like acting you are all good ninety five percent of you are poor as dirt three percent of you are right in the middle and two percent of you are extremely wealthy and the vast majority like i said ninety five percent are dirt poor yknow i don want to do that i mean i i my dad a doctor i was raised in high society i don want to leave high society i like it there i like it there a lot yeah and um so i was like i better get out of better get out of the music thing so i decided to go into business but um i can get into business until i get a punch a bunch prerequisite courses out of the way because my a is on it i in after last this quarter i did really good this quarter after this quarter it up to a two two and i not gonna be able to get into the business school until i ve got a bunch prerequisites out of the way and they re sequences i can take accounting two twelve until i done with two eleven i can take i two hundred and two one until i done with two hundred and all that junk so i had to take this stupid class this summer because if i gonna get in when i want to um i have yknow i hafta take it this summer i hate taking classes in summer when i well because i rather just i rather just work and and not worry about the classes and then have all sorts of fun all summer long with all my friends but it not gonna work yeah rest my brain a little bit but i still searching for a job it not that i can find jobs it just that i can find the one i want i mean the job market is huge down here in columbus i mean i want a job right around nine ten dollars an hour so i can get a full forty hour week and they won have a problem with me leaving at five clock because i have a class at five thirty but that what i doing this summer i still searching for a job i would ve i would ve done some more searching today but i ve had a few problems with my satanic computer stupid i swear it possessed i i if i could figure out how to work disk and format in dos i might be able to figure out what my problem is because i ve started running two i started running windows two thousand about three months ago that was a dumb mistake one of the guys in my house is software prirate and he got me a copy of two thousand he was like your computer will run two thousand let put it on your computer so i was i was like okay alright what are the advantages and he like dude let just put on your computer so i like alright fine i don care so we put it on my computer and i ve had nothing but problems since i don know how anyone can run two thousand if they don know what they re doing i trying to find drivers because i ve had to find i ve had to find drivers for everything i mean they don oh yeah and also it directed towards businesses it technology which is divisigned divised for network businesses and well anyways it got a different file structure format than windows ninety eight i it runs it runs on and fat thirty two and i hafta switch it back to fat sixteen and i can get the partitioning right for my for my drive because fat sixteen can handle anything above two gigs for the primary drive and my drive is ten gig drive so i hafta partition it and i can figure out how to get silly thing partitioned because every time i try and work around it and make partition through disk i get these really wacky errors everything gets transferred over to drive and i have no more drive it gone i don know where it vanishes to so it i it is no and i can do a stinking thing on my computer i hafta use all the other guys computers in my house kept promoting and then all of sudden about nineties they came around and said yknow what our kr our deficit is going the other we re we re going way out of whack on this thing that because we ve been spending more are doing the same thing they haven that mom and dad remember mom when out and got a little piece as the time as they needed things no i want the whole house completely furnished i want the cars we don talk about buying nowadays we talk about leasing cars and pretty soon we re not gonna be buying houses we ll be leasing houses from the finance companies we won be owning the land the finance company own the you don own it you re leasing it and that our quality of and when we go to third world countries we say i don know how they can stand living here and yknow what they probably have better quality of understanding one another then we do because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further you become apart you said were their governments respons government stays out of that our problem government into too many things they need to be out of your nose wi that your personal business they need to be out of your business a the personal thing is you need to have ethics in the business world in other words i used to work uh during highschool days for a furniture company back in those days it was nine days we sell it to people and the and i said well gee we just and we talked to the manager oh they they don have the mon they don have the money that financed the well why are we selling it to them then well we ll get our money back and the bank bank get the money and we ll get a we ll repossess it and we sold the same darn thing over three or four this poor sucker is out there get stuck with credit ratings the bank making money we re making money they re losing now is that business ethics i ask you is it no is it proper business eth ethics that where we need to correct that where you need to correct you can just say hey we got a schnook out here we can screw him that a problem and you re saying does it ih does it does it take home does it take church it takes morals and that why i was telling before we got away from morals in our society we could care less about you i always say a a uh good successful salesman will be able to sell his own mother i mean sell his own mother on a on the market you re not gonna make as much the people are gonna say gee i not going to them i place else again it gets back to weaknesses in our standards in society we we could care less about anybody else we don hey if i have problems the government is gonna help me out that a mindset that been entrenched for forty some it a mindset that if you talk to the older generations are dying off now that said we would never had in our lifetime it a ruination of our country and if you are old enough to remember kruschev i believe krushchev is right we will bury you we ll bury you internally in other words we will break you up you will separate internally you have dysfunctional people we are we re dysfunctional families if you ever work on pastoral care activity you ll find out that people are so concerned about their families that they they fail they think because their family is broken up they ve got single parents here they ve got divorced here uh they don know what going on they re doing drugs well the problem is we never got involved as you said busy we make more time yknow there more time spent for soccer on sunday then going to church you talk about uh they said was it meet the press quo as i think slogan is a without meet a sunday without meet the press yknow day was it something like sunday not a sunday without meet the well hey that just tells you right there where our thoughts we re of ourselves i guarantee it as you get older you start thinking a little differently and i think as you talk you should be talking to some older people i saying people um in the in their eighties to find out how the progression of life is and how you think because when you go to estate sales all you re talking about this profit motive you re sitting on a lawns the quality of life is in the mind the person you re you you avoided all the time and that what we re concerned with you need to interact more with people we need to interact more people every day of our life that what we learn from we don learn by giving things to people just like if you were um a parent giving a giving allowance you don give them to your kids uh money to do chores and that you don expect them to do but you give them something in addition to develop more responsibility but we don talk about responsibility in our society today i i i dare you to say we re in a eh they say publicly this is our bill of responsibility do you know where there is do we talk about responsibilities now if you if if if you say buy buy from those unscrupulous business people and say ah gee these guys got it on credit yeah what happens to that person that files bankruptcy ah file bankruptcy it okay i ll do something else next time we start them over again they have never learned and reason why you re throwing out out too much in front of them without saying hey you gotta do this to prove this to me we we we lack one heck a lot of moral standards in this country we re losing it every day and until we start looking at ourselves in in the mirror at night and say i proud of myself i proud of what i did i may not have made a dollar but i understood somebody no oh i i don think it necessarily that i think it comes back to the lack of self discipline no i you had women that working before you had women working before but self discipline is family it part of it self discipline making things too easy for us oh we can do without it you ever you ever try to work for something i mean you really struggle to to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me but but was if that if that but if that was given to you if they lowered the standards if they lowered the standards for you to get into graduate it wouldn that be challenging for you hey great they lowered it for me my sister didn have oh she had a rough time getting in but now i can get in anywhere i got a lower sta doe doesn that doesn that mean make so when you compare right they and that it they hadn had a challenge you need to have challenges put to you everyday everyday you have more meaningfulness in life so that when you put your head down at night you re saying oh i thankful for what i did gosh darn it i still coming to you i more help tomorrow because without something there gonna be a motivation factor someone gotta give you a drill and to get up tomorrow morning and say hey i gonna do a better job today than i did yesterday but when we as a society say oh gee he struggled yesterday well let lower this thing bar let lower the bar a little more let lower yknow gosh darn it hey scooney you didn make that last shot last night hey hey time out let give scooney two more minutes to make let let him have another shoot he gets two more minutes to try to get it and we ll just watch okay come on scooney he made it okay he made it in three minutes thirty seconds left he made it we win now does that make the game interesting to you and the thing that was always cool about my mom is tha uh it was somebody that wasn real nice to or that i didn really like she wouldn have anything to do with them i mean the whole thing was yknow if i approve of this person then then that was always her main focus so that was real nice and i was her maid of honor when they got married it was just it was well of course about this big but she always she always put me first and i think that that made it a lot more positive for me um hum oh yeah i would say so oh yeah um hum well i had to drive her down here last time so i didn want to come back i didn want to come if she has to come back i might as well go with her i just kidding we went to get something to eat i dropped her off and she took the bus home we re talking about um hum um hum um i think that i don think that divorce is a bad thing i think that it it it if you re married and realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family that it better to just say look this is not we both deserve to be happy and we de and go your own ways um i think that i think for me personally i would certainly i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i wouldn end up getting divorced just because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as like coordinating and i know that sounds kinda petty but just um i mean i don think it i don think it bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously to continue to a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different yknow there things about my dad that and i wouldn want to live with uh he great and he wonderful to me i mean my dad is really wonderful to me but i mean things like like when my mom had me he didn pick her up from the hospital i mean it that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking yknow like i said he great to me and and everything but i wouldn i wouldn want to be married to him yknow i wouldn and would i expect my mom to stay with with that in that kind of a situation no way i would want her to be happy and i would want my dad to be happy also so ultimately for that situation think it was much better um they got married kind of young too yknow and i think that i think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be a little bit more careful i know that that now it a lot different than it used to be people would get married and they just be expected to stay together and there a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and they re miserable yknow what the point of staying married and being miserable i think it better to get a divorce than than to do that see i don agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together only thing that gonna happen is it gonna trickle down and you re gonna have to listen to them being miserable and i think it much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that miserable and they fight and then you feel like it your yknow people say it a my fault because this happened yknow and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i can imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um so i don ne that a totally different perspective to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger no that not what i mean no i don i don mean it that way but i just mean i think it it i think it better that if people are get to a point where they can work it out i mean i think that that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and and maybe there is some way to work it out but i mean if you get to the point you where there isn then you just have to i don know i think you have to be in the situation in my situation i think for my parents it better that they split up because they re both very happy now mm um hum um hum but i don know if that i think that the divorce rate has gone up because it more socially acceptable i sure there plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have gotten a had that been an option um i think it just think a lot of it is just depends on the way you handle it yknow how you how you handle it after after the divorce is final i mean not do you see wha does that make any sense at all yeah yeah i mean it is it it it it a touch i think it think it tough and i think it really an individual basis but i wouldn i would say that there a lot of other things that are th that would contribute more to problems than divorce i really don think that that would be the main because um i think the fact that things like ih responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take of your family instead of uh yknow things as far as people getting pregnant and then this person goes off and leaves and you ve got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and and it just it more socially acceptable to to be able to do these things now then i think it was a long time ago i mean peoples families wouldn would never stand for something like that they say look you need to take care of this you need to deal with this and now it just it kind of normal and everybody just kinda goes along with it hum yeah see i it well if it doesn if it doesn work than i can well that what my best friend amy said i ll get married and hell if it doesn work i ll just get divorced that a great attitude to have but i mean yeah i don know i mean guess for me i just i just think jason and i get along so well yknow and we and we ve been together for about two years and i i don know i just do i just just really like him i don know if i ll feel that way in ten years from now but it certainly there a lot of things that our families are very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about about different things we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things you have to look at from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him and um his name was jason too but he drank a lot great guy but he sure liked to get drunk yknow and the problem was he would turn into such a jerk yknow and i just though it i just don i just don like this is not so is this something when i look long term is this something that i wanna deal with for the rest of my life and i said no it just isn yknow and i think that you have to look a and see if you re compatible with somebody yknow people get into situations and they marry people that you you ve from the outside you can look and you can think are you nuts yknow that is never gonna work so i think that you just kinda hafta take into consideration yknow are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that gonna be be that gonna work and be positive yeah i don i don i not old enough to know anything um hum it a lot bigger um the things that i notice that are different i guess a i mean you look like a as far as expansion obviously there a lot of areas that that are developed now that didn used to be certainly spent most of my time in the areas that i grew up i mean i don i don really go over to the east side very very often yknow sometimes we go over yknow in highschool and drive and see if we could see a prostitute yknow or something like that but um i don i don know wha as far as i don really keep up with statistics as far as the crime rate and those types of things i mean i don know if it the media uh that yknow kin portrays as there more than there used to be um i know that when i was younger i was allowed to to do a lot more things uh by myself like to to go places on the bus and those types of things and than my family allowed to do now so i don know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with the with a bigger city when you get more people there obviously gonna be wi some more problems um and uh i mean that that really all that i know so it obviously a lot more build up it gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and um hum um hum hum um hum um i don i don think so but um hum i doubt it i think he needs counseling that point hmm personally no i don think so hum um i had considered that yes i just actually i was going to send my son to a kindergarten but i decided to home school instead so i ve been home schooling him for kindergarten um hum because i want his morals and hi yknow his basic stuff to come from me really yeah um hum i exactly i wish i would have taken typing and home ec in high school and i was too busy with college prep and yknow what good did that do me i exactly um hum life skills exactly everybody needs to know that information for credit cards yeah my husband was one of those we re still working those problems yeah and it stays with you for years they don realize that nobody tells them until after the um hum oh yeah i have no idea i i knew that kindergarten because it it not required in the state of ohio anyway they really aren required to be in school or enrolled in anything until they re six by september when i found that out was like oh ok cool yknow can keep them home i mean he he could probably go into the second grade i mean he very bright he can read and write and add and he yknow he so it a challenge for me oh yeah oh yeah we re crazy he an educator which is all the more reason to home because he sees it and he like yeah they get it from us so i know exactly right i ve seen some of the work from my husband ninth and tenth graders because he an english teacher and i was appalled because they were writing at like a fourth or fifth grade level and they re ninth and tenth graders and i mean di did just yknow even their manuscript and yknow just how they wrote and was like wow i couldn believe it um hum doesn that a bunch of malarky that just one of those myths i think that to make people feel guilty or something but it not gonna work i mean they if you re around people i mean number one they re around their parents and their siblings and that socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you re around people and you re around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i ve read and seen that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they re not relying so much on their peers and their peer opinions because for one example the pokemon craze my son didn know what pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it and yknow it just like stuff like that it just like they don they don know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face yknow and then even still they re just like oh it cool because everybody else likes it they don really know what it is or what it about or i mean yknow what i mean because it like now they just blow up each other or whatever it like really what is the point to the whole thing and he didn know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about it oh it must be cool because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it wasn cool so that was my influ our influence on him rather than the peer influence on him um hum right exactly yeah it is and it not it my house isn as clean as i would like it to be but yeah but that just one minor minor thing and i feel like i just in a kind of a phase if you will it yknow because they ll be grown up in a blink of an eye so if i i mean if i put my career or whatever on hold it gonna be worth it in the long run when my kids are grown up and they could be like yeah mom was there they taught yknow mom and dad taught us yknow all of our life application skills that we need to know now and i think that that ll be better in the long run for them and that the responsibility i took on as being a parent so that my job even though it is mundane and monotonous at yeah exactly oh you re just you re just a a homemaker what do you do sit on the couch and watch tv and eat bon bons all day yknow it kind of exactly that the that the idea that people get they don i don think they realize that how much it is yeah and it a challenge living on one income that why i ve got a part time job now um hum exactly um hum um hum they re i don know that staying home is for everyone and i don think parenting is for everyone and it really makes me sad when i see somebody yknow well we just want our yeah right right yeah i mean you don want to see the chain gangs or the people whipping them i mean let that not right either um but yeah i not for the weight rooms because like they said they come out and then they re stronger they can do more damage yeah and you re like and we paid for that okay so i i i think just to keep them busy yknow even if they educate them i ve heard of people yknow the education um th i strong i i don think it really hurt anybody um i and th i say incorporate that with some education um of some so yknow mean i don wanna go out in the sun and work for five or what not plus they re doing something in return for free housing do yknow what i mean it kind of a give and take there yeah yeah um hum um hum right right right yeah well unfortunately i don think it fair but i think in the long run i i i it doesn have to be a college education because most of those people probably wouldn want a college education um but like a trade or a skill or something it ll give them a little bit of hope if they do wanna choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it it it up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun um i mean if they want a college education um yeah it it not fair but for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they didn get an education i mean now that a broad spectrum and i know it not all that cut and um yeah it would upset me but hopefully i step back from it a little bit and go well maybe it is for the best yeah yeah i think it is course we were fiddling with that so much ah yeah yeah yeah i guess so there i mean there people who spend seem to psend hours doing computers doing this type of thing just going out there and seeing what they can find i know i i do not want to go i don want to touch a computer when i go home uh no that okay ya know don i just don want to touch it i just i do anything but touch the computer and sometimes it like six and seven hours a day at the computer and i just don wanna do it yeah no no and too many wires here got it uh no it a it a it basically eight five yeah monday through friday uh just i i traveled some and so i had to travel on a weekend so i got to ya know comp time so i gave myself a long weekend yeah it is i wish i wish i been last weekend it was real nice last weekend so i gave gave myself a long weekend and just catch up just sleep a little bit run around my daughter getting ready to go to italy so that yeah so that taking some running around uh it a high school chri trip uh she in eleventh grade yeah they re going it spring break couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids no teachers couple teachers side take a bunch a kid every couple years they go to a different country uh it bishop it a now you re you re not from around here so it like it a catholic school over on the west side we had to pay for the yeah oh yeah we oh yeah yeah we re for it yeah it a tour it a package tour ah ya know rome florence venice pisa doesn interest me yeah yeah they only have like couple days in each city that that not much i like going some place and spending a week and just exploring yeah my wife and i like to do that yeah the relaxants yeah yeah we did that my wife and i been to san francisco couple times first time was did all the tourist things and the next time i said well let just go let just go and wander round and see and we spent more time in both of em ah both of them are good for different ya know yeah i got a son he a senior at otterbein yeah about four five years it not that bad how old oh that is very young yeah you don want another one die and ya know diapers out of the way before you go to the next one yeah it worked out fine for us no uh was just the usual thing since she touched my things ya know because they were far apart enough they had their own social groups they had their own friends and so ya know so that and interests so it there wasn much of that but there was the usual ya know she breathing on me in the car he humming too loud i don know if you ve got brothers and sisters but yeah you ve probably been you ve went through it all yeah well there were five of us and a lot of that no no i think with five of em it just it more more constant well no well kids went catholic schools up through eighth grade then he wanted to switch to public school it was columbus he went to uh fort hayes um pretty good he liked it a lot but it was a big change from the catholic school big change uh he liked it a lot but i don know if you re familiar with fort hayes it a um it um college prep um i don they call it alternative school it called magnet school in most places um it it college prep with an emphasis on the arts and there some career programs there so it was a good good for him yeah and uh and a lot of performing arts you were expected to take something in performing and visual arts every year uh which is good for him the catholic school he was going to go to was big on sports and my son athletic and so this was that why he didn wanna go so this this was a good choice for him or that yeah uh i don know um yeah well um i think the teachers are every bit as good as dedicated but i think there seems to be uh the whole administration up through the board and just it not as focused ya know i don know how to describe it like the teachers are sah sort of hae it seemed like they almost had the feeling they re on their own where it more cohesive within the catholic schools like that seems to be very clear they re all going in the same direction and working as a team i don know if you ever listened to any of the uh columbus board of education meetings are on the radio uh pretty interesting everybody talks and frequently nobody listening it it yeah it it pretty interesting um talking about how they don have the money for this and they don have the money for that and then somebody comes up with well let spend the money over on something else and nobody acts on it then they go on to something else oh yeah well uh it like the well you ha how long have you been here uh okay well there few years ago there was this big fuss so ya know we got to close some schools ya know enrollment dropping it ya know it the way population goes enrollment dropping we can afford to keep them all going so let close and they did this big study and they targeted some to close well there was a big uproar from the people who kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close a school so the board backed down and changed it mind the next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools but there wasn the money for it so there was a big fuss about that then two years later they came out with another study it says well they need to refurbish or not some schools close a couple then knock some down and rebuild em and it like every two years it a different direction and it like they re almost afraid to take a stand that somebody not gonna like well if you re gonna shut a school down somebody gonna be really ticked off right i my my kids went to a school that well my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the auditorium and said we re closing next year and it was hard but yeah once it reached the point that decision is made and announced and i mean there good reasons for it um and they explained the reasons and ya know at some point you have to figure out how much do you wanna fight something when it inevitable well that the problem i think yknow we re right there within moments if there a flood or yknow something like that you call the contra i ll be in thursday yknow if your air condition so they re always gonna have to have people here so i just feel they re either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people than have twenty people that half of them know what going on half of them don so but that tough to do when you re starting people at eight dollars an hour and stuff so there yknow wendy mcdonald there places that you can make that money so um hum my yknow to me the thing that hurt me the most out of it is they wanna put caps on our salaries so i at the highest scale i can go right now as far as job title i there no other job i can move to until unless i move in to supervision or some up in the and i ll be out of the union if i do that anyways so but they re gonna put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which i almost there right now i only like fifty cents away from that cap and if that the case if i retire in six years i ll be capped out right now so then in other words i wanna retire in six years if i don change jobs making exactly what i make now which that was my worst fear of it all but that wasn even on the table they were still worried about this two dollars and get this hosp yeah that what they were fighting for was the low end and didn try to get the hospital and the uh main campus the same um yeah there yknow our shop only has about five people out of twenty maybe that have been here over ten years probably lot of turnover a lot of people go on to management positions and or leave or but once you ve got twenty and it like you you can leave now yknow i like locked in now so yknow i ll be forty eight when i retire from here and i ll be able to go out in the workplace and feel like i ve gotten good education and work skills from working here for this long and yknow they ve definitely paid for classes for me so i don know what they re big gripe is for education when they re striking and all this because i ve never had a problem if you wanna take a class we get classes we can take anything we want so it available it just whether they go and put forth the effort so sure yeah you can take yeah i mean people graduate get degrees from ohio state working here taking one course a qu one course a quarter and get a degree in history or whatever it might take them to ten years or something yknow but it like why not it free yeah why not take advantage of this yeah why not take advantage of that so um i don know yknow i ve keep thinking about that all time but it i like i want something where i can be off during the summer so i can take my kids and we can go out west or yknow have because my wife in the same boat she ll retire two years after i do and our kids yknow will be young i five year old and i only have six years to go so we re talking eleven years old yeah then they won wanna go anywhere with you so it a pipe now is when i need to be with them yknow where we can take them out and run yeah uh we ve been very happy with the daycare i don know if you have any association with but oh it it just unbelievable our daughter went there her from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade and uh i mean when she got out of that daycare she could read she could write she could do computer yknow yknow it an education it not yknow people you pay for it one of your highers but yknow higher amount of money for yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good daycare because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so that how it first started before it you wasn even on campus it was over on like fourth or summit in a church when it first started but yknow it just not yknow people are always saying i can believe how much you pay for daycare and i like but look what we re getting yknow people take their kids to somebody neighbor house and the lady can be sitting them in front of the tv and and nothing happens yknow over here yeah over here you have students that coming in and work as work studies and this and that and they re in the education field or this they re gung ho they re ready to go a quarter changes and a whole group new pumped in yknow and most of the teachers there are mothers themselves and yknow they have computers in the room they ve learning yknow it really yknow we ve sending both of them to kindergarten at too they offer a kindergarten program there mainly because it all day where in the hilliard school system and theirs is a half a day so we feel we re better off leaving them there than bussing them to a half a day kindergarten then bussing them to a daycare that near their school so we might as well do all day plenty of time they get a nap they yknow they get fed and all that so been really happy with the daycare there mm hmm where from oh my wow oh that it mm hmm yeah there not a lot around yknow and we were on the list forever we were on the list five years before we had our first kid they called well are you still wanna be on the list yeah we don have any children but keep us on the yknow and it like you said it a and there three or four hundred kids in that daycare it a large daycare but there not a lot out there that good quality yknow i mean you ll it scary and then you see it in the news and then they were abusing the kids or you know and you don wanna go to work feeling that you re worrying about your kids and we ve never really felt like that and we kind of work a little different shifts my wife and i so our kids are only actually there about five hours a day because she doesn start until nine thirty and i pick them up at four so yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then then she can take the boy over to the daycare and then they re only there five hours or so their daycare oh i don know it tough i think really i believe more in that large corporations need to have some kind of daycare offered it just there not that many people anymore that can afford to have a one income family i mean yknow we could do it yknow but yknow we wouldn live as nice as we do we wouldn have as nice of cars as we do yknow we struggle a little more so so it a toss up it a real yknow it a real worried and you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you re going oh geezy are we doing the right thing yknow but yknow some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with we sit down and talk about it and we re just like i don think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff yknow and you know kept them entertained all day long by ourselves yknow there no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids yknow they re all in daycare they yknow yknow they just aren around anymore it not the same anymore where yknow every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so yknow they ve made a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter is in a different school still associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the daycare so and they don know any different yknow they don understand the concept so they don know any different of yknow why didn we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think yknow they benefited a lot from it now the ultimate would probably be a part time thing yknow if but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time work we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the worlds so mm hmm you can do part time you can do three or two day a week um hum um hum um hum yeah oh yeah um hum yeah um hum it a job it a full time my wife and i are both like oh i can wait to get work work be easier than this yknow because now they re getting to the age where they re fighting more and yknow and you got a boy and a girl and yknow it yknow always something going on so yeah a pizza you know now i ve seen more people violent on liquor like said i worked in bars and i and i ve it just like cocaine and stuff like that you know your laws are different crack cocaine one the powder cocaine another you know and what they re saying i on that is uh that a prejudice thing is what they re saying cause they re saying more blacks do crack cocaine than powder cocaine cause of prison thing i sure you ve read the papers the way i look at it uh i ve had four heart attacks every time i have a heart attack okay they swear up and down i do cocaine which i ve never done i don want to but to me some drugs should be legal some drugs should be illegal but to me alcohol should be more illegal than half your drugs because i ve seen more violence on alcohol i ve seen more women beat i ve seen more kids beat i ve seen more drunken driving wrecks yknow well you seen people driving wrong way on the freeway right when they re drunk when the last time you read about somebody driving the wrong way on the freeway from smoking a joint guh yeah or that or they re so paranoid you know what i mean they re worried about stopping and i just using that as an example you know what i mean your other drugs i don know much about them well they always did because first time i had one i was thirty six years old and whenever you have a heart attack anymore they always sus suspect coke is the first thing because it stops your heart right away yeah that what i mean they go by your age too yeah and then when they yeah yeah then when they did the blood test they found out i had hypertension plus disease had nothing do with not really you just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around yeah it was painful but no worse than going to the hospital for my back surgery my back surgery was worse than a heart attack ever was yeah uh i blew a out and i couldn walk at all so they i have insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they wouldn admit me they told me they were going to make wait two months before they did anything and what i did i had my wife drive me down to the hospital i crawled out of the car crawled into the hospital and told them either admit me or i crawl out the door like i told ya i can be an idiot yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the door as an employee being turned away and for some reason they admitted me then i hypertension when i had the first two and then the last two i had now i got cardiovascular disease i still got one of my arteries about eighty percent blocked i got another one fifty percent blocked and i got a dead spot on my heart right now so when i exercise uh my heart slows down let put it this way where i work at i work here at this will be something good to get on your tape and they ve got people over there where i work at that they will give them the days off if their cats are sick they ll also give them let them work seventy five percent if they re sick i had a heart attack had to come back to work early because i was out of sick leave and like i said i ve been here twenty five years and they would not even put me on first shift because they said it wasn a good enough reason yeah until i threatened to sue them second and third i was working sixteen hour days a lot of times covering that one of the reasons they weren going to move me well my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better if i slept at night instead of staying up cause of your internal clock and i was trying to do everything and then also too they wanted me to go to therapy which was scheduled in the evenings i when was working and i couldn even go to therapy when i threatened to take them to court and it took almost two months after that but i i had a note in before i had the heart attack i already had two heart attacks i had a note in that i needed to be on first shift or i probably have another heart attack and they would not put me on first shift then i had another heart attack put me in the hospital and then i had a heart another heart attack when i was in the hospital and when i came out that when i gave them another note stating i needed to really be on first shift and that when they said no it a it all documented yeah told me to exercise which i do told me quit smoking which i been trying no offense it harder to quit uh yeah stay away from salts uh sodium and stuff like that pop uh coffee i don have no problem there i don drink coffee i drink a lot of pop though uh like pork products yeah yeah because i don like vegetables my hands are going to sleep i don like vegetables is what it is so it real hard for me uh the exercise i do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so but in the winter is when yknow i mean i don exercise that much my bill collectors are the ones that scared of that it like this what can i do you know what i yeah but you put up with that anywhere it not just ohio state it be anywhere you go yknow it just like i said you get excuse me your assholes in they leave then you get either another asshole or somebody good you just wait until you get somebody good it like you re doing interviews you might think i an idiot but you know what i mean the next person walks in the door might be real good but you understand what i mean you just you just keep going that part of life you pick up something you learn it and you keep going well i i work with around mostly black people and it a weird situation uh they re more prejudiced that i ve noticed now than when i only worked around a couple of them yeah because uh they re more you always hear about my black ass my you know what i mean and stuff like this and i could give a shit you know what i mean it don matter to me whether you re black or white it matters to me whether way you treat me like when i first got out service is when they really started affirmative action i was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they couldn hire me because of that was when they first come down with a mandate that they could only hire blacks so i was shut out of the job market then uh that didn even bother me i thought well fine i went that when i got the job at channel four but uh it like anything else some blacks use it for good some blacks use it for bad and if i was in the same i be doing the same thing so you know what i mean i a veteran so i get points for veteran so you know what i mean everybody gets something you re a woman you re a minority right you re over me my supervisor black my last manager at the hospital was black plus my supervisor over there was black my brother in law black my other brother in law arab my other brother in law arab let see the kids that i just kept taking care of for my sister in law they re all arabs the three kids i had living with me two summers ago were all black uh i did have a white kid my son living there and that about it oh there a lot of racism a whole lot your little clitchs cliques it like being back in high school yknow but nobody ever yknow what they wanted me do was put him on ritalin and i didn like him on ritalin i didn like what it did to him uh it turned him into a zombie yeah i i mean i used to those uh boy like yknow jumping all over the house and uh yknow just always just active and he always been very active in sports but when i put him on the ritalin he was um laying on the couch yknow just zombied out yeah i didn know yknow what the problem was and yknow i just kept having these problems with him so they told me i need take him the school said i need take him psychiatrist psychologist and uh so i took him and she said do you think this is normal yknow because he like rolling off the and banging dolls together i i don know i said i got one brother i don know how boys are supposed to be she says well this is not normal i like okay so uh i don know i tried taking him to um psychologists they did like behavioral therapy i brought him here to ohio state and put him in a an experiment uh he was in it for about three years working with a food supplement and uh it actually did real well for him and the researcher what he yknow uh it it like sort of like taking vitamins he gave supplies of that even after the project was over but then after there wasn any more he couldn give it to me and it cost too much for me to buy it i ve never heard of it being developed commercially so uh he finally decided uh yknow after oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his kept his desk in the hallway yknow yeah they just kick him to the hallway he was either yknow in the hallway or in uh the office and and the nuns would say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivia questions that was grade school yknow the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting into any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports um hum so when he uh was a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking i gotta get it together what am i gonna do so he uh agreed to go to psychiatrist and uh so he went on ritalin uh so he took the ritalin through his last of his junior year and his senior year now he on a medication they call uh wellbutrin his doctor um doesn believe in ritalin so he gives him a drug called wellbutrin which is a yknow like an antidepressant type thing that they said works for uh a but it really helped him yknow concentrate to be able to study oh yeah um hum yeah he got energy yeah i saying that it not right for some people but yknow wasn right for my son it is yeah because pediatricians are able to dispense it and um i just yknow felt like trying to avoid it as much as possible yknow growing up see that that the difference uh worthington has a yknow program for them um one of the women that i worked with she was having so many problems similar to mine and her clipping child son was in um columbus schools and she moved to westerville and put him in this class for that and it took care of it they don have that for columbus schools i don have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all no i i i don think so well it gotta come from the top yknow i i just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student from every direction so i would say yknow it an organizational problem with no yknow no motivation uh yknow to do their job yknow properly now i live down the street from what they call a it the columbus uh alternative high school and uh you get there through a lottery system and they have the best reputation of all the columbus schools and uh those kids leave there getting full scholarships uh my son went there one year uh uh it was a disaster for him but yknow it a very clipping environment and nonstructured environment which my son wouldn have worked in and then they don have sports but these kids get scholarships to some of the major colleges throughout the united states and we re talking big money scholarsh full scholarships so if they re able to do it there at that one school yknow they could they could do it my granddaughter my one granddaughter uh they live in springfield they just moved to springfield and she goes to kindergarten only a half day and this child is only uh five years old uh he has them reading the newspaper watching the news she told me a story about col christopher columbus um discovering america that was so deep and intense couldn believe it was coming from a five year old so this is what the teacher is doing down there and she wouldn have learned that a whole day kindergarten here well i would say in springfield yeah i can say yknow i cant say that it an ex expectation i i still say it has to come from the top down uh you ve gotta have the leadership uh you ve gotta have the right people uh to have this school structured properly and the yknow the people with the right credentials uh for the job yknow and uh i telling you some of these principals that uh that i ve dealt with uh were highly overpaid as far as i was concerned for what they were doing um yknow one gah one principal that from my um daughter high school he was out partying all the time they yknow they he was come he was riding around in a corvette and uh he tried to take me out and he was always like really red faced and the kids would say yknow he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back and that was one of the better schools in columbus and yknow i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of um uh principals driving big fabulous cars and not doing anything my son uh yknow with his disorder he would constantly be uh late for school and i uh called the school and told them this was in high school because i didn start dating until i was almost seventeen but almost everybody else st had even i gonna be thirty six here in a week or two so we re i graduated in eighty where i think kids are dating at like ten heaven forbid but i sitting here going i mean i didn even know what i was doing when i started dating at almost seventeen um so no i think i think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are um i i personally don think a school can do it um i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general or family unit does it um and it wasn that i had a bad family unit it was just that there wasn yknow we never talked about it my sister and i were just talking about that because we she goes we were like yknow how did people start talking about and relationships and what not she goes you don mem mom and dad handed me a book i like they did i like i don remember that and she goes well after i read the book i asked them a lot of questions so maybe they didn give it to yknow like how we don wanna go through this again because she a little older than i thought that was hilarious like you mean sexual relationships and what um probably the the bad things about it yeah um but just coming from my christian beliefs and what not the best thing and i know it even though i didn partake in it when i was a teenager and i wasn promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage um just to be it be nice if they teach you how to be confident in your self and i don mean like self esteem but yknow like we said if if uh yknow you come from a situation like that that doesn mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of yeah right well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way doesn mean it the right and um i yeah i yknow i really struggle with that because i come more from i think the family should teach it but let be realistic how many families are gonna do that or have the mentality to do that it seems like um sound like my dad but it like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids shouldn be and the people that would be decent parent aren because of the situations and what not um just my fam nobody in my fam my sister doesn have kids i don have kids we re in our mid to late thirties um our friends just had one um i do have some friends that have like more than one which is great because they re just great parents i ll know those kids are gonna be going in but then i have uh other people that like my other friends that just had one were trying to help a a child nin children services that came from yknow imagine it and that basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids by three different dads and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually had her move in with them they were her temporary foster parents and she just turned sixteen so she was fifteen when she moved in with them she refused to change and i don know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier but basically all three of them i don wanna say are doomed but they re not even though they re out of that environment they re not doing any better so i don know yeah so it kind of like i for education in schools but um just like the bad things about it yknow sex can do you can get pregnant number one which isn fun number two yknow the diseases and things like that i think that a good idea to teach just that it not all uh fun and peer pressure and stuff i know i kind of got off track there but hum no because they re gonna learn that on their own um a i personally think that it a choice i don think you re born that way because a i i have friends that are homosexual and um yknow wa i don believe in what they re doing but i don do everything right everyday so i still love them and they re my friends and blah blah blah because but i ve also known people that were that way and now are heterosexual and are much happier and they realize that it was just a choice they made and things like that um so it in today day and age they re gonna learn about it quickly and i don really think it something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like what do they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think that i don think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up in i don know what i grew up in but i ll i ll give an example i didn grow up in let say somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to country music doesn mean if somebody doesn do that they re not okay i think that would be a good idea or yknow cultures all are different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or do yknow what i mean that that is something different um accept the people you don have to like what they re doing but they re still people so yeah yeah yeah um yeah i it hard because i i do come a i a christian so i believe that homosexuality is wrong but i don like i said i not gonna condemn them um at all like i said i have friends it i understand what you re saying um but i think that something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out that maybe that child um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort and not actually incorporate it in a thirty student ensemble um uh it be nice if we had more of an open environment in schools and if teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talk to them about it and then send them on that counseling one on one way um just because if you re gonna teach it to um a large amount of students i not even sure if that one sh student would listen because all the rest of them wund probably be making cracks and just make them feel do you know what i mean i don feel yeah yknow they probably all hey you resemble that remark or i so i hesitate to say that it would really help them um it would just be better if somebody could yknow keep their eyes open or if we um more counselors or things like that to deal with everything including that normally i would say no but yeah i do just because let face it they re probably do it anyhow and i would feel better for them and if i if they used it because uh yknow it not good for the children that are born it not good for them um i prefer abstinence but let be realistic yknow i think we re past that point now um i know a lot of christians argue oh but you re wrong well yeah i might be wrong but yknow we can go backwards on that i don think you can only work on your own it right eh eh is not gonna work right even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be dloved so bad that it was something that i yknow what i mean and i knew better but you just yknow and it like well i wasn that strong granted but i was probably the most normal teen and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost it much younger than seventeen yknow ok eleven twelve it like ew he we even look alike forget it but um yeah so i think i think birth control would be good and four five six seven eight nine is that just to get a volume level excuse me you didn screw on right and yeah okay um hmm oh here in columbus yeah i ve aw i ve always lived in columbus yeah west side yeah eh not really he kind of between the west and the south area southwest yeah uh the area i live in uh now is the west gate area uh we grew up on the hilltop area right now i live in the west gate which is a little further west yeah it gone downhill a lot uh yiy yeah they uh near uh near west side is always been in pretty bad area well in the last forty or fifty years and it starting to creep west into the hilltop area yeah we were just talking about that last night my wife and i been thinking that another five years we might wanna get out of here yeah we re buying it yeah and we should have it paid off about five years so we re talking about moving someplace a little simpler to take care of a condominium or something one floor plan yeah it seventy years old um so there always something going wrong with the wiring or the plumbing or the something and uh it seemed like a good idea about twenty five years ago to get a house a older house but uh no not anymore um hum oh yeah i ve uh one son nineteen he trying to find himself there been a lot of uh a lot of problems with him he a brilliant kid uh they told us in elementary school he had the highest i they ever had tested he very creative uh very talented musically uh he was taking lessons from um gene walker that teaches jazz saxophone here at the university and he said that he thought charlie had the makings to be a profess to make a living career as a jazz saxophonist uh but there also in the last four years or so a lot of uh mental health problems creep crept up multiple health problems he ran away for a while there was drug abuse alcohol and uh he was essentially asked to leave high school uh and he went to columbus alternative which is considered one of the top high schools in the state and he was asked to leave um he wims in a psych ward for a while uh in some ways he seemed to have gotten it together um uh he working full time at united dairy farmers um he involved with an uh very much involved with uh having a baby in another month uh well not not really she only sixteen and he nineteen she quit high school the end of ninth grade uh within a few months had her is filling out forms now to start go to college in the fall uh in becoming uh an engineering uh tech she looking at two or three different areas so i not sure which uh she can convince him to gi he says he needs the have a but he hasn done anything about i don think he we ve always had the feeling that he had a uh um a fear of failing because he was so good at anything that he really wanted to do that the areas that he was not good at math for instance is an example he just got very frustrated with and just wouldn try uh he very talented he had artwork published poetry published um he won he won a statewide award a gold medal for bagpipe playing yeah he doing none of that anymore so it very frustrating for us and the baby they re giving up for adoption so that a whole different problem not really uh he come to accept it but uh it was her decision yeah it was one thing to know that it the best thing for the baby but it another thing my wife and i are trying to deal with emotionally that we re very family oriented that this is a grandchild we ll never get to see watch grow up and that very hard on us but it is an open adoption uh they ve met the couple several times uh they ve promised to ya know send pictures and keep keep them updated and stuff like that so uh uh westerville yeah so that difficult for us to deal with and and i gonna hold you to this confidentiality cause very few people know about this my brother knows about it and my mother and that the only ones in my family that are even aware of it so because we just don wanna be bothered with a lot of questions cause it hard for us to deal with no this all started long before that actually just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that yes the baby gonna be born i i think he just kind of tried to ignore it for a long time but it all very obvious now um and she she great we really like her and she has helped us straighten him around a lot he has been under a psychologist care for about three years and a psychiatrist for about a year and a half she very bright she very di she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her um parents divorced when she was about four her mother an alcoholic her father said that he would take her with him and then after they got divorced he changed his mind so she pretty much raised herself et it it a it it terrible things what she to go through and she made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that helped straighten him out some and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or the the drugs was not the problem and we ve dealt with several counselors and that all they wanted to deal with our prom has always been it a symptom uh took the psychologist a year and a half but he finally agre charlie is he very intuitive and eh even as a toddler he could do this he wu he seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from him as a toddler and it it not intentional it just the way he is so he was able to circumvent anything that the psychologist was trying till he had finally admitted it yeah he had a problem and then things went much more smoothly and that there still not really convinced of the diagnosis cause there multiple problems and they haven ruled out that some of the other things yet he could he just knew how to get around anything yeah it it it to deal with he was tough but he was uh he was always tough and we didn realize it for years we didn have anything to compare to he the only one kid we got uh he was very the psychologist told us that ya know we were talked about things that happened when he was growing said you must had a terrible time gra raising him cause he was not an easy kid we didn know any different was our job so we did it well he always had some problems it um his problem staying focused on things unless it something he extremely interested in then you can get him away from it um if it something he it the just an example in school he would sit there and he be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they re trying to teach something in class or spe working on a writing assignment or something and half hour to work on it he be the last five minutes the teacher say you know you really need to get that done he sit down and write it the fifth grade he was writing on a college level and he could do it that quickly um i think he lost ground on that now but and that was just an example in the second grade the school he went to was an open classroom and uh he had been through some couple the traditional schools already and the principal said we had told the pren talked to the principal about the problems we were having with him staying focused and she said well we can work with that well ha about halfway through the year she says it not working and they have an arrangement and with and i doubt if most the people in the schoo parents in the school are even aware of this with childrens hospital the counseling center they set a room aside and they send counselors in once a month to work with the students it open classroom it experimental so there people coming and going all the time and no but how we were never aware of it i i doubt if most the people are aware of it and they met with us and then a week later they went and observed him and he was they were the teacher was telling a story and then asking questions about and said he was the counselors said he was up and walking around and running around and playing with his shoes and stuff like that she said but if came time to answer the questions he knew every answer so he said he that they decided not to precede at that time because this is frustrating too it was our wedding anniversary and my wife said now how about for our wedding anniversary we just get a good report for the whole week but that was unusual and he wasn a bad kid he just disruptive and uh he said okay week later she said we didn get any bad reports thank you and he said she said are you gonna continue he said yeah it a lot easier for the rest the year we got no bad reports from first grade the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed and but the principle wouldn let her give it to him to give him something had to do what everything anybody else in the class was doing he was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade and it the last grading period she give him sh everyday she give him a math paper to work on and he said i showed you i i know how to do this i not doing it we were up talking to her almost daily on the phone in her office and the ya know the last week he sd she said you know there only one week of school left she said well i better do my work and sat down and did it it extremely difficult to deal with uh and he had been through a counseling experience before and it jih and it he just played along with it then to get out of it i think that he does and his love fuh he he his music is extremely good he taught himself so he by ya know sixteen he playing eight instruments very well uh he just and he can do that now where he lives now he lives with uh this another thing that boggles my mind his uh girlfriend mother she he afraid her girlf his girlfriend that her daughter was gonna run away so she let them sleep together in their house when she her daughter was fourteen uh yeah it a little hard to accept um yknow i thing it it it hard to know what he going through wa how much of it um normal teenage rebellion and how much of it just yeah it mainly what happens is uh you get all the out of town bad stuff yeah i mean just kind of absorbs like a sponge huh well i not the mayor or anything so i not gonna make any promises yeah i don think um i don think there should be anymore uh new developments just yet yknow just to kind of weed out a little bit of the population put one part of the population in this neighborhood and yknow just pretty much divide it all so it not too uh not too crowded one place and then not to vacant other places yeah that what i talking about exactly you get people moving in these nice big houses out in dublin that fine and all but then what about these apartments down here on the west side yknow that they don even do anything with mean you have so many acres here that yknow free space pretty much nobody living there and nobody do anything about it yeah if they uh if they pretty much straighten up all the bad neighborhoods as they well they re not bad until people make them bad yknow just fix up everything get some better lighting better security better police force no doubt i mean bad enough everybody else talks about them but i don need to everybody else knows yeah it pretty bad when you re uh walking out in the street and uh some guy tries to take off your necklace run with it and yknow the cops right there and yeah it this happened to me guy took my necklace and started running the other way with it i grabbed him by back of his shirt just enough to stop him and i saw car coming up kind of slow so i just yknow pushed him over the top the car wasn even going but five miles an hour and it happened to be a cop and the cop started asking me questions knowing that he probably witnessed this whole thing happen probably wouldn have even stopped he sitting there going what are you doing with this guy and why is he on my car and all this stuff i said i want him arrested man he took my necklace tried take them all radio too and uh yknow i kind of threw that in there make it sound bad i was on my way to work man i didn want it anything bad to happen to me or him yknow so all in all the cop yknow put guy in handcuffs put him back car he goes well do you want to press charges and at that time i was little bit over my limit with the anger thing i said no just let him out of the car i ll beat his ass oh man the cop said something that i never forget he said i would but that probably hafta be my job to do if we was living like that i was like god man rodney king all over again no he was white just a real down just looked like he was from the ghetto just nasty guy well i lived in the ghetto so he had to live he had to live in another ghetto well yeah that pretty much what i was thinking he looked kind of yknow unbathed and sticky and real real rat looking face and um most likely that about it man we had neighbors that did that shit too and i really didn like that man you got people right next door a woman and her children yknow and she in there smoking crack yknow like god man i got to get away from this before ih the something really goes down mean hell she might ve ripped off her dealer and uh dealer comes back shoots place up and being right next door oops he misses and hits my window tough luck bob yeah no take it from somebody who been in this city long enough it not really the it it no georgia yeah well you go down georgia just about everywhere except for atlanta evr anywhere else you go savannah you go to columbus georgia you go to duluth any of those places are fine and dandy but you go to atlanta you see a lot of the somle some similarities here the only thing is atlanta has a bus and a train system metro atlanta rail and transit authority well it pretty bad when the first day you re in georgia you go through atlanta and you see hookers on corner of what would be main street here yknow they call it a boulevard down there and um yknow it when you go down there doesn really help to see that stuff because it reminds you of where you left but uh the smaller town i went to southeast of georgia or uh atlanta was really great i mean it just nice laid back country setting and you don hafta worry about that much crime well your horse might get taken in middle of night but i don have any uh doing another job yeah plus i had to get away from here again i was getting real fed up with people i was living around i told my mom i coming down here as a vacation slash work met a lot of cool people and uh survived two tornados well the guy that was i was working with yknow he kind of ripped me off and he uh yeah he owed me about three hundred dollars in wages for that week didn come across to giving it to me so i accidentally got on the phone with the i in cincinnati and told them that he was paying me under the table and got him busted well yeah i could ve just took him out in the woods and whupped him but what that gonna prove no i wouldn have i wouldn have been smiling from down there to up here when he dropped me off he didn even no not as we was driving it was uh i told him i need this money for this thing and yknow yknow it was pretty much pay day i want to go out get some food go out and have a drink and yknow just save up some my money so i can get a car didn seem that way to him he yknow you and all this stuff he flapped off at the gums a lot and i didn like that so i went up there to the pay phone and i called two places called my mom first yknow tell her i on my way up and then called the i in cincinnati and told them that he owns a business he got this and this and this and he paid me and this other guy under the table this much and you re technically only allowed to have so many hours a day to be doing free jobs or tax free jobs and uh i was agreeing with it until he got on my bad side yeah um hum ten thousand dollar fine oh man talk about cutting a coupon there man i mean he would ve he would ve been in the money then because he was just starting his business down there and uh while i while i was down there he had me sleeping in a truck a moving truck and uh oh man it was it a hilarious story i mean thirty foot moving truck i sleeping in it and i get uh it salt water fish he can eat fresh water um but no see and i would have never yknow you don know until you get a reaction like that no i had a cat that just died yeah sixteen yeah um hum wow uh yeah um yeah uh we re planning on moving in the spring and i hoping to get i i gonna get a puppy and a kitten together we want a dog and we ve kinda been waiting um but i like both animals i like seeing them grow up together and i love kittens and yknow i but i gonna wait we re not sure um we re looking to uh we rent now and we re looking to buy house probably um northwest area actually i live in clintonville now and it real convenient but the houses are so old and i just tired of living in an old they re nice but um hum yeah right um huh that perfect um hum oh um hum see that how my husband was they didn have a pet growing up and i just can imagine i had dogs and cats we did and i loved it and i just think kids need that and it just a different kind of love i think yknow they learn from it and you look forward to coming home yknow and the pets waiting on right right hm yeah hm that great yeah um hum oh is he well my husband was allergic when we first got together but i hafta admit um it it they well he went he goes to he has other allergies um so he gets shots and things but yknow they always say it the pet dander and uh eventually he he was alright with it he got used to it um i ve always heard and i i very clean anyways but yknow when you hafta vacuum a lot and everything and you re constantly picking up that dander rather than just let it sit and accumulate um but they always say don let the animals sleep with you and all that and with a cat and they curl up with you it hard to say get no but you know what honestly eventually well it it took probably a year he stopped sneezing yknow he did sneeze but he knew i wasn gonna get rid the cat i had her she was my daughter and so eventually he did he and he just got used to her and he always said well i so allergic but but then he didn have any problems um hum now when he goes to my sister house and she has three cats and he not around them then when we leave his eyes are itching and yknow i mean so it is true um with different pets but yes you re right um hum oh i sure no yeah we have that many animals yknow people yeah it is but see i ve always i i have one floors where i live now i vacuum them i mean i just the type yknow i didn want pet hair and things yknow collecting but it hard with my sister cats because she has a little girl and no she didn go home and vacuum every day yknow but um i think when you have two or pets you hafta make a little bit more effort yeah we both love sports um we love college football we come as many games as we can um uh we both golf and um like hiking swimming uh every year we usually go on a trip this year we went to new mexico we were thinking about moving out there um it really beautiful out there we like we like mountains and yknow walking around uh we got married in lake tahoe which is really beautiful it beautiful and we like going to see the ski resorts everything i don really ski um i do more summer sports but um he just beginning on the computer um i pretty computer illiterate i ve really never had a job yet it always been working with food or plants um so he he learning about the computer now it gonna be kind of a hobby unknown least it not a work thing but i know we can do lot of things for our house yknow with the computer and everything um he uh he a really good handyman he can do anything so he really helped me he he really into zah design and stuff so he likes to paint and um yknow he really open he learned a lot about gardening for me and yknow that one of my main things is gardening and flowers and i know i know i am i can wait because i the house we live in it a half double with we had a front porch and a deck which i really decked out but yknow i have like eighty plants my house now but i just can wait to have my own space i never plant anything in the ground there because i thought well i going to leave yknow i just didn wanna do that a lot of people do that but yknow it just such an investment then when you leave and but um i really enjoy that wow that great um hum oh they re beautiful um hum oh yes but that great though um hum yeah um hum well that great yeah definitely i yes yep um hum i don know yknow columbus is so saturated with golf courses and my parents all through growing up they played golf and i really was interested in it um i just think enoughs enough so i yeah there so many but i have to admit eh when we go to try play golf sometimes and not have a tee time you can even get in so all over columbus they re all booked and so you keep thinking well yknow they need more but i was hoping they could use that land for something else i don know there yknow there so many not building but yknow something maybe especially in dublin but it it probably it ll be good for columbus because i they feel they have the need for it there so many golfers i mean that sports went sky high mean when my mom used to play golf growing up and they only let them on just one day a week which is amazing was like on a tuesday and when i lived in florida a lot of the courses were like that too and i thought they re only allowing women one day a week yknow isn that amazing there so many good women golfers now and but they said they re too slow and they always talk and and that just killed me when my mom that the only day she could play and she wanted to play more so things have come a little bit yknow better but um there still such restrictions with women yknow in this sport especially i think golf um hum right right you can no um hum right it is but it it that was good for new albany to have that i mean i think it it was great to have it there and i think a lot of people um did enjoy going there because there not very many women tournaments that come around here yeah i don know i i think those kids are uh they re lack something in their upbringing and i don know what it is um thank goodness none of my kids ever took that sort of attitude and uh i like to i like to think that my wife and i set them a good example my wife was a uh very conscientious hard working woman she established a secretarial business there at our ha uh for several years and uh anything that went out of there was right i mean and uh she did well quite a lot of typing for students over here graduate students and so she i gave her most uh credit for our kids upbringing her mother was a cousin of uh james thurber and was a a want a want to be writer i mean her mother was she she wrote a well she wrote quite a number of poems and and paid to have them published in a small booklet and some of some of them were real good and some of them and my wife wrote some poetry too she be down there typing and she she always had these uh spiral notebooks and she stop and get an idea for a poem maybe from something she is working on or i don know what but but anyway uh she di she wrote quite a few poems some of them real good poetry i thought most of them of more or less a religious nature and moral nature in fact uh i uh the desk that she had we we finished off part of our basement she had her office down there and uh her desk is still down there and one of the typewriters that she used but it i don know it been disused too for too long i guess because i ve tried type on it it uh doesn shift like it should and so uh but anyway she hadn i don know how many these spiral notebooks around and she just write in them and uh since she passed away in nineteen seventy nine i have run across i well i just fi finally decided well those notebooks are down there and if i need one for something i ll just go ahead and use it and i ve run across a couple of her poems that i didn know anything about and then was or uh sort of good uh huh yeah huh i think so although she was working at her desk most of the time so that she didn give them as much attention as as uh a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or needed her to say no to something she was there and uh yeah i think that uh that probably had something to do with it and the fact that our kids knew what our moral beliefs were and uh my oldest son uh completed what they call the god and country award in the church which is acroia uh requires about as much work as uh eagle award in the scouts it a a scout sponsored but church centered uh award and then my second second son got a his eagle award in the scouts i kind of proud of that because it uh well it not something that a lot of kids do yknow my oldest son was in vietnam yeah in fact he uh let see i i spo i don remember but i suppose that they had a draft when he was about twenty one anyway he he went in for less than a year i think and then he was discharged and then he was called back in and sent to vietnam and it was uh sort of a traumatic experience for him that i think he has pretty well come out of but he was in a rural area he never was up where he was doing any shooting himself but uh he was on one day and uh he said they had a big an area out away from any of the other buildings where they burned trash and that sort of stuff so he said the mess sergeant says um shoemaker take that can of trash out and uh and burn it and you probably better use take some gasoline to throw on the stuff to get it to burn so he did he went out there and threw some gasoline on it not knowing that one of the other had been there ahead of him and thrown gasoline on it so there was i don know how much gasoline on it when he threw a match on it it burned his his front anyway he got his hands up in front of his face so it didn burn his face but it burned his legs and his stomach and uh so he was in a hospital in japan for some time and then came home but uh he never would never say a lot about it but he just didn have a very high opinion of the army and then a couple of years later he was working on a job in the columbus coated fabrics plant which is plant that makes coated fabrics they make uh the main thing is uh auto upholstery car upholstery anyway they had big rolling machines that rolled this stuff out and there fumes came off of it so they had a big hood and exhaust system above it and periodically they would have to clean those out because uh the fan would draw in addition to fumes they draw some lint off of this uh so he was up on top on these rollers cleaning out the hood and with supposedly nonflammable solvent but it wasn because it caught fire and that time he was burned on the back he been burned front and back he was in the hospital burn ward for i don know two or three weeks and it it was um the year that one of the years that ohio state played in the rose bowl now that the nearest i can uh identify the time but uh and the ti during the time that he was there a girl who he he been going with just occasionally not real steady was there to see him every day and when shortly after he was healed enough to go back to work why they were married and had the two daughters hum oh yeah that too true it uh hum well and yknow you can have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they re not gonna be quiet and they re not gonna yknow um look at this flattery right yknow that that the thing so i think just being aware and then also like i said with uh with all the i mean a and i uh i so opinionated in this too and anybody that knows me i look at all the advertising i look at the advertising and i look through and like i see lazarus and i see kohl and i see sears you look through and you say oh okay you know you re looking for things to buy well then you got a two whole two pages of women in bras and they re looking at the camera they re seductively looking at the camera and you re like okay how many wo how many different bras do women really need not for the women i sorry yknow most women by the time they re bu buying bras know what choices they have yknow don need all that but then it funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at the men the men heads are usually cut off they re not wearing any kind of revealing underwear at all i mean it just so unequal so we lead these these guys or these poor boys that are growing up we push all this and yknow and then expect them to deal with it yknow and they see tv shows and and everything else that yknow it okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she yknow i mean i think it what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and and what we re allowed to to show our kids yknow you get involved in the free speech and that fine but wait till those kids grow up and and wait till those people that were pushing the free speech gets mugged or yknow anything else happens to them um the yeah um governma or the yeah the government mayors the yknow but then look at them i mean there another example well yeah well i mean so that not the pra that not the case but it all it an uh uh man too yknow i mean i think women would be more efficient and they would see those things because we ve had to live with them forever yknow even movies that little kids are going to see if there a woman in there there she yknow half naked and she should be a center fold somewhere yknow and those are little kid yeah disney movies cartoons i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and it really scary um but nobody doing anything about it that i can see and they don really see a concern but like i said wait till the generations start growing up wait till those little kids that we ve put all those things in their head grows up then they ll think wow we should have done something i know well i i scared i hope i don live real long because it it scary well and then the guy that um i don even remember what his name was he got a drunk driving charge a judge he was a judge now he out he went back to work on monday so yknow what kind of example is he setting for everybody else oh we throw the book away on some of these other guy i mean the throw the key away on some of these guys and yknow we want set them an as an example and yknow this one guy had one i two years ago so we really ha to he gotta be in jail for five years yknow then this judge i mean he got probably ten years of history with drugs and alcohol and he still and he still a judge monday morning he goes to work yeah yeah yeah i don see figure that out i think it all i think it all yeah they don know about it but then yknow they like you said they don wanna see it yknow i if it doesn affect them it not there and if they don have to yeah well people people don have the priorities they should yknow what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you do yknow did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything yknow i not to me if you don have time then yknow you re just floating along trying to taking up space no yeah we yup you have to concentrate on what important or it just flies by and you don even see it yeah yeah right can take it with you or something yeah right yeah well you can even put a price on it either so it no i think i thrive on stress i think it keeps me uh going or something but i do have to do something that is accomplishing something i don wanna sit in an office i ve already done that day in and day out working for other people that i don even approve of that are making way too much money anyway and uh have to well looking at me oh you want a dollar more yknow i mean and they re making thousands um but yeah i don wanna do that any more i wanna go somewhere i ve got somebody helping me kind of yknow um just an acquaintance of mine um that kind of a headhunter and i ve given him the idea that i wanna either work for an attorney that gonna make some changes or yknow do something that way i ve got a lot of administration yknow and and manager and things like that background so i can have fun doing what i know how to do but also accomplishing something that what i wanna do i haven found it yet i ve got an interview with a radio station though and that kinda off the thing a little because that ll be fun yeah just in their corporate offices and that would be fun so eventually i ll have my own radio if they interviewed me and knew that they be like quick get that girl out of here no but that that like the most exciting thing right now is that i mean that looks real promising but and if i do that then i gonna have to do something voluntary or some uh voluntary work or uh choices uh i looked at that too that choices for domestic violence that an organization that i think would be real interesting and help me feel like yknow helping people um they give uh new direction for abused uh wives and mothers and um help them get on their feet yknow give them access to the different organizations that are out there basically hide them until they can get on their own because if they re abused the husbands are like yknow a nightmare out there so things like that yeah i be so frustrated i probably oh i would be really oh oh wow oh see and she probably really good yeah see yup really yeah i don feel old at all i mean i yknow a lot of people think wow you should know what you wanna do or yknow and and i guess there is different phases like uh maslow hierarchy what is that the um the hierarchy of needs masler maslow anyway he has different levels of things that people need different ages and things like that uh yknow and at forty you you think wow yknow and you really need to make a difference or do something and and i can see that cause i ve gone through all the phases that he talking about so yeah right yeah okay oh no that fine thanks oh oh i was gonna say it would be interesting yep because i ve things that are not physically possible they re supposed to be not physically possible goes against the first law of physics but i saw it happen i experienced it well ah um and some of our ceremonies uh this is confidential right no one else is gonna see this because i don wanna um i don wanna have any of this printed or anything yknow it uh okay all right well in in the ambiguous part of it yknow just saying try to be protective of the ways of the people of this land that there in a a ceremony called an eneepee which is a sweat lodge and a lot of people will talk about sweat lodge um it involves heating up stones in a fire and putting the stones lodge and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs it not a sauna it not a uh steam room uh it a very spiritual experience yes it gets hot in there how hot who knows but it been such a strengthening spiritually strengthening thing it also physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out of your body because of that heat um it gets all the crap out of you yknow it clears you purifies you that what it was for that what the people used it for purification and even it made up of four rounds usually sometimes three and the last round is usually called the purification round where whoever pouring the sweat the spiritual leader that pouring the sweat he ll make it tough on you he ll pour all the water that left in that bucket and he ll do it in a way it just brings that heat out that steam that breath that sacred breath is what we call it god um and breathing that it like when we were in the womb of her mother we were breathing water we were breathing fluid um oxygen is in that fluid too it in that mist that goes over the the fields god in that yknow um even when a cow takes a crap in the middle of the field and that steam comes off it in the winter time god in that steam a lot of people can understand that um so the the laws of thermodynamics say that it impossible for rocks to retain heat that way and that they can be heated to an adequate point of of withholding heat or sustaining heat when heated by a fire that you would need like in the old days yknow to melt metal they used uh air pumping it through like the blacksmiths or whatever yknow melt and soften the metal so they could work with it yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire kept for a long period of time will be hotter than any kind of fire you ve ever touched or been around and that fire is sacred it a sacred fire uh so that why it possible but if it if i went down there with the laws of physics told me that those rocks couldn sustain heat yet i see when the fire keeper breaks them out of the out of the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that they re red orange glowing you gonna tell me they re not hot so that that one example um yes i ve done it for the last uh bout five years uh how many i don know it doesn matter um been in many ones that were too hard for me and i had to get out uh and other ones i it a it a struggle with that thing and understanding it takes time to understand it lot of people lot of good people are helping me to try and understand it um i was trying to let the fear of that um though i not afraid to die i afraid sometimes that i ll die before i get a chance to do what i feel i was sent here to do which is just the basic things fall in love with somebody have children raise them and move on um that that basically my fear but uh as one of the guys tried to help me he said well listen i afraid of that too and he said because right there in that pit there that god now if you remember that there nothing in here that can hurt you even as hot as it gets yknow and when you think about that you try not to think too much while you re in there although it hard to do especially if you re thinking about how hot it is but if you re listening to people praying and they re praying with their heart and i tell you because of how hot it gets in there you ll hear people pray straight from their heart not a bunch of real fancy words in a real comfortable setting yknow that that heat will that sacred heat will bring what in your heart out and sometimes you ll say stuff that doesn even make sense but you say it and it brings it out and that what it for so i mean it uh it a struggle understanding that and uh i i made it through all four rounds this time and uh i even sat up which was the first time um it a struggle but it a it necessary for the way i follow if i didn especially for men women have a purification every month with their cycle uh that the way the indian people believe that many of the woman refer to it as they re on their moon because when the moon out the moon is that sacred and there that that life women have that uh gift of life that they can give uh men can do that um there just a lot there that uh yknow women go through that purification every month so women really don need the sweat lodge but it there for them and they do participate um i ve been some places where some men refuse to sweat with women sometimes i felt kinda weird about it just because uh um women have a medicine yknow and probably because that was lacking in my life um i couldn focus on what i needed to focus on when i heard a woman voice in there but then some of the elders sat me down and and the other thing about the sweat lodge is men go in there in shorts women go in there in a long cotton dress you ll hear people say you go in there naked uh that not true i mean uh some of the older men in older tribes and different tribes um they ll be naked but they ll still go in with a huge towel on yknow so it not a there was a man named sun bear who was uh recruiting women yknow and telling them they had to sweat naked yknow so he could get a look at them which is very disrespectful but yknow there some psychos out there man i mean there some psycho around here in town called rainbow eagle gave himself that name didn earn it the indian way didn have it done through ceremony nothing like that and even the man that he followed for a while sitting in a rest home over in south dakota now because he old he on his way out and he was a road man gave his life yknow for eighty nine tribes to help them find and refine their connection with their spirituality that they lost um because of the missionaries bringing christianity i mean um i ve got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here and that what i saying atoning for sins it quite a hypocrisy when you got a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door of the church was a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sword drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now i asked the priest cold hard question uh like because there not like like a a like a defined lead lead person because just one person doing it most of the most of time i mean like people do have groups that play like techno beat oriented music but it not like a lead singer who like yknow is like that it not like that at all yeah i mean it like it known but it in a different way it like a different type of fame than like traditional style so it like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like like it more of like a it not like an type thing yknow like i don know it like it it really serious and it really not serious like it it everything i guess yeah like a lot of people like i don i don know why a lot of people go but like with a a lot of people i know it like go to hear really good and like it amazing like what happens yknow like people together and like people dancing together you look out and everybody dancing yknow and like music really good and everybody really into it and working yeah like underground no it gotten real big like it still different too there still like a really big scene and there still like a smaller underground scene like it like a double scene like it weird yeah word no i i don wanna like i don wanna spin like i just wanna like i don know try and do different things like like most music i listen to is like drum and bass where it like basslines and like staggered backbeats and stuff and like i can play bass and like i i have like like a processor thing and stuff that i fool around with just doing stuff like that and some of my friends like play on drum machines and stuff like that so i just do stuff like that more like it not it not like you re playing like you re not spinning records just like making yeah yeah just like there a lot of different uh like influences and everything and like there just a lot of places you can go with it so it real good yeah yeah yeah yeah like like sort of i mean with like threes and stuff people do a lot of that but it it i don i don know i don i don really go on the internet all that much like i don know yeah yeah well like um like my dad like went to florida and i was with him there for a little while and then i um he moved to texas because like he was moving into like the he was going to there and like so i moved back from florida back to up up here because i didn wanna i didn wanna go with because texas is terrible and like um so then like my mom see like my parents got divorced when i was like five or something and so um i was living with my mom and like half and half like joint custody or whatever i was living with my mom half with my dad and then when my dad moved to florida i moved with him and then uh my mom ended up getting remarried and like my dad have remarried by that time too and my mom remarried and and they lived moved out to sunbury and like this house on five acres or whatever and so then um when i came back i just lived with her up there yeah think when i was five because it was like yeah yeah i don really re remember them being really together like ever but i don know it was real weird i um i don know i mean i i like florida just because it not cold and it it really nice but it rains a lot i mean and i i mean i i rather live out west because it like a dry heat as opposed to being i mean it nice that it ninety degrees but it not nice that it like ninety percent humidity i mean that kind of kind of sucks but um it just different to live in florida and how you think of florida being is real different like um i like it because kind of the drivers aren so insane like they are here like people are a little bit more laid back just because like um i know in parts it is really insane but like sometimes just people would just like because it all because it nice weather people don get so like aggravated by like here it like cold and and grey and you just wanna like yell at people in your car and stuff or something i don know i don know if people deal is um but yeah i don know yeah i think it like there like a real like either it it old people who are there retiring or whatever or it more of like a younger people there i don know you don see a lot i don know there is middle aged people there but it not so apparent like as here i guess yeah that what it seems i mean i know it like i mean it the same proportions i mean there are more old people there but just seems more apparent just because of how but you can like go outside all the time yknow i mean there never like three or four months where you just wanna sit in your house and um i was in more north florida around tallahassee so that a that a little different i mean that that not that more southern georgia basically um i don know i mean yeah it not so touristy and they had they had the thing where you couldn have any buildings bigger than the state capital because they didn want it to be like orlando or miami like miami especially so that was really interesting it was a different type of town like not not so many palm trees more big oak trees and stuff like that yeah it real it more not all of a centralized downtown it more of a like spreading out yeah it a lot smaller than columbus though i think columbus is really interesting how it how it de develops compared to like i don know just like how like how columbus is different it is a a real standard midwest city just how it designed and laid out compared to like philadelphia yknow or uh just like when it was settled and and when it was made just how like more of the streets are more it all like planned out more as opposed to like in in philly or places like that more east coast it like the roads parts of them are real small and like and other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff and so that kind of interesting i mean i think it also odd like the urban sprawl of columbus how it um just the suburbs develop and how it like more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized area that really big like our like columbus downtown it really odd too i mean there nothing to do down there it all businesses and like the couple shops that are down there close at like six i mean there like couple restaurants or something but i mean it it different when you think of other cities yknow it more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it like campus or more of my mom never had an epidural jason mom never had an ep yknow and that looks worse to me did you see that it takes twenty minutes they thread this thing this needle in your back they put this that sounds worse to me than even having a baby i just can sai i don want anything in my back i guess it true you just have to wait and see once you get there what happens see that great though was it hard really hmm right right uh hum really see we almost think that that would be better but when you put it like that it cer certainly um hum yeah that true that a pretty good analogy um hum hm something to think about oh the it was the vide the the video tapes that i didn like it wasn the class that was ski the class was kinda goofy but um it was that and watching the cesareans which i just i not a oh yeah they showed they cut open the they re pulling this baby out of this little hole of this ladies stomach and i just uh i had a heart surgery when i was younger and so i ve had lots of needles and those types of things and i when it comes to needles and that kinda stuff i just kind of squeamish about it yknow so that stuff i just i just don want to see it yeah i mean it not i mean it was a really long time ago everything fine but i guess for me i just i don know it just it just a little more a little more than i wanted to see but the classes i think were helpful but um what you ask me oh yeah i think i think they ll be very helpful i was going to for um to deliver the baby so i decided to take the classes there and basically my mom had reminded me over and over again sarah you need to schedule er lamaze classes so i called and and i scheduled them um hum yeah jason and and i and i went together and basically they were three weeks long they were about four and a half hours the first one was really long yknow jason was he i can take this last night wasn so bad though i mean the first one was a lot of lot of information classroom kind of stuff but he did real well he was much he just a sweet sweetheart he just wonderful he was much more interactive than a lot of the other guys were just kinda yknow they would sit there and they weren breathing and they were kinda rolling their eyes and i just think god you bunch of bums yknow it gonna come down to it yknow and and you re gonna be so awful and he just real supportive and and just he just terrific it makes does it makes it better um hum yep you re doing um the parenting stuff they gave us a video to watch at home which was things like how to diaper your a thing about whether you should leave them crying in their in their bassinet or crib which of course think is horrible and i think it good that they ve come out with all these new studies that tell people don do that um lets see what else was there feeding your baby i mean it just that kind of stuff so it was mostly th like what we would do is we would talk about we talk about like like as far as while you re in labor uh breast feeding there was a lot of that i could tell these poor guys are like uh can we not talk about yknow they were all kind of uncomfortable um and then like lets see a lot of it was mean most of it was was like pre and then there was the breathing that we did at the end but other than the video it was mostly like labor related they tie it with it was all very pro breast fee you could tell you could really tell that they had an opinion about this um we talked about positives and negatives of breast feeding things about um he like the immune syste some of that stuff i already knew they had this thing about um the nurse said that there have been studies done where babies that have been breast fed have higher i which i she said that and i said are you i was right and that the way i felt about it i not saying that that not a possibility but for someone to actually state in a class if you breast feed your baby they re gonna have a higher i than if you don i um hum the bonding or breast feeding right and i think that yknow i think that it just because yknow do so because i know i ve done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just yknow they the nurse says something you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kinda strange but i mean i think there a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that it i would want to do it for for a while as long as i could but i don know really really really huh that different um hum hm she okay right oh well sure hm yeah really huh yeah the we didn really get the the video tape they gave us was half infomercials and then things things like how to clean the umbilical chor i mean stuff like that but you re you you as far as actual parenting things on it there was really nothing even in the package of information they gave us i think it would probably i think it would be certainly interesting uh to come down and be so it made squirm a little bit always in my happened i was like i know who he talking to my mother two sisters married southern baptists ministers they they always they have to go i guess it a church it more ruled by the di it like a not a diocese but it more ruled by the convention the you where to go to preach and they were always in places like washington state and louisiana and tennessee and idaho and and just every where but it made to visit them long car trips one is in um ah see oregon near the coast forget the name the town not far eh it it along uh i think it along the in oregon uh near eugene or like that and um the is in like which is where my mom family came from they came from yeah my background is interesting my mother was born in louisiana and uh my father was born in new rochelle new york as the son of immigrant jewish from it is and it was world war two brought them um my my dad was uh in at end of the war he was in the army air corps he never had to go over seas that he was and louisiana and um where my mom a young high school student just graduating from and so they together there moved to um aerospace industry my dad uh had a degree in um engineering uh uh what kind of engineering drafting engineering i think and um worked for in california and they asked him to move the north plant in columbus out near the when it was north american before it became rockwell and um that why we moved here and that why i grew up on the east side uh it was close to there and um and i was one year old we took car trip across the i don much of that how we moved well not just one my older brother would have been two and a half or three yeah i know i know i right but at least we the stuff to look us interested and and a lot of i ve always to travel by yeah it it fun and it because of that early conditioning i ve been i ve been in forty eight states never in alaska or hawaii but for all yeah all forty lower that right you been um do you know a group called um midnight oil yeah they re pretty good i like them yeah uh huh uh i learned about them from somebody i was working with who liked them listened to a lot of loaned me i taped it and their street i don know if you ve ever seen that it fun it was fun they they it just set up uh on a flat bed truck on in new york and do a there uh huh uh huh it was yeah so i like pretty much all kinds of music yeah dig sometimes to find the kind of music i really don like that much and i like some country music my i guess my favorites are are classical and uh rock rock and roll i some of that now i like oldies the seventies and and uh i guess what hard for me to listen to is i guess i don know it used to i where they part of the reason was i they just played the same songs over and over again yeah and the funny thing about that is if i heard one of those songs once i might not be that turned off it but if you re play it at me yknow in three hours right right right right right right yeah yeah i don know if you remember you might not be quite old enough but you may know the song sinead connor nothing compares to when when um when that song came out you would probably hear it least twelve times a day on some of those radio stations and it got so i just cannot stand this i can it uh huh huh well and you know itself if i heard it or eh it yeah and she an interesting character i guess i mean i don know everything about her i remember that she insulted the pope yeah um hum um um hum uh huh well let ah somebody else who not that well known do you know john gorka have you heard of him he really worth looking into he he funny he has good songs he a folk singer really uh along the lines of uh maybe arlo guthry or somebody i mean he does electric stuff but he also does acoustic and um he writes most of his own songs yeah and dh eh if you ever see something by him you should it or if you see it in a friend collection ask to listen to it he has of the are funny and some of them the you ve uh let see funny ones are examples of funny ones are winter cows let see i can think of too of them right now uh yeah yeah a i think he originally from uh uh huh i don know where he uh i ve seen him he bands i remember mcguffey lane i don know if you know who they are yeah they wrote a song probably their most famous one was called green grass and high times forever don know if that was what it was called the three yknow i think those are still very important because you do have to have a higher education most of the time to do anything these days so they definitely have to have their grounding at there so they can go forward i know i wish i knew how to sew i can do buttons that about it um hum yeah exactly um hum i say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but not i don think that you can say everything yknow you have everybody has do this because yknow people are individuals and you have to take that in to consideration i think so um hum um hum that good um hum um hum i don know i don know i sure it would happen because there all kinds of wacky people out there seriously i don know i have the family members that are homosexual that just my own personal thing beliefs i don know i think that they shouldn have taken it off of the whatever it was i don know um hum um hum somewhat um hum yeah oh yeah so he gonna be can complain about something well that another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook yknow most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toast but yknow that about all that they wanna do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook yknow they just do it because yknow they re supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the hu the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all the cooking and the wife does yknow whatever she does i mean it it individuality again so yeah my dad a chauvinist pig is no um probably not he thought it was great that i was going to school but but then he disowned me so it doesn mm yeah and i do have a brother by the way he didn he works in a factory oh well um i i suppose well i ve i decided that i was going to date a black guy and my hus my dad didn like that at all so he disowned me and so now i married to my husband and my husband is black and and exactly because not only is he a chauvinist pig but he a bigot a racist so um hum um hum really i didn know that okay uh huh um hum diversity um hum um hum um hum yeah because it the midwest yeah that cool never no he doesn have anything he won he won talk to me yet it is and it isn because i i where he is and he really messed up and i i can do anything for him but i ve yknow i ve i open to a relationship with him again with the news reports with uh um different bombings and the i think the jewish school caught my attention and now that he is in daycare i mean we did a pretty good screening but you still always kind of wonder what going on he done quite well he i mean he learned how to use scissors how to color he socially learning how to play with other kids those were all things he wasn doing at home potty training been a big deal because all the other kids in class are doing it and um hum yes yes he talks about biting even though he never bit and um there one particular boy right now when his family leaves he just has complete temper tantrums and he tried that out a few times too he one you can leave and it doesn phase him he very comfortable with other people but like last month or so he tried that a few times and i think he picked that up at day care seeing the other kids do that it quite possible but we pick the day care that i thought was closest to well the one that was open had the closest values that we had um i personally would like a church based program but uh there aren any well there weren any open when we were looking for one um we did have the option of going here to to their day care and it has a wonderful reputation an everybody that i ve talked to that has had children there is very pleased with the program but what i didn like was so that if they weren um imparting values on the children they don celebrate any holidays at all they just kind of ignore everything where he is now i still like getting my mother day card in i mean they re doing trick or treat thing on thursday they re going door to door they get to dress up or he wouldn have gotten any of that at and there pros and cons to to both of those but i guess almost at i wish they would celebrate every holiday so then they re exposed to all of it instead of none of it right do kwaanza do chanukah do so that they can learn other cultures and the other values but they just don do any of them yes um hum right i think it important to know what the person values an customs are and to support whatever it is an if i mean we ve done some wild things over there but i mean it i mean we ve changed rooms around beds around positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed uh face the north star or uh they needed to have this thing above the bed or under the bed and i mean if it important for them to have prayer then i think it important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need i don think forcing prayer on somebody if they don believe in it i don think that the right thing to do but i would have a hard time believing i mean if the person knew i would think if the person knew that people were praying for them at church and that was important to them and they prayed and i i uh i would find that hard to believe personally i ve heard some of them talk about it yes none of it i mean it kind of the traditional light at the um uh uh like a big tunnel with a bright light at the end or uh they were floating above themselves looking down at themselves at the accident scene uh um seeing a dead relative something like that i believe them i do i i i it i mean it a very personal thing and if that what they saw most of my patients are head traumas so they can come up with some pretty wild stories but those visions are usually pretty clear and i don argue with em i don debate it it just like it might no right no definitely and it really makes you aware of your own mortality i mean things you see every day i mean never know it can happen to anybody anytime just like that accident yesterday with um right i mean you just never know how freaky it just weird right my father died when i was two so i think just being raised yknow by a single parent made you well aware of um hum yes uh his mother died um the week after we got married she had diabetes um uh juvenile diabetes diagnosed at age eleven and just over the years um ended up having open heart surgery and didn make it through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i a nurse not very good just because of the two family experiences nothing coming to mind no oh wow one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen um hum um hum um originally north side right in there yeah my grandmother is from ireland my grandmother and grandfather are both from ireland um hum or ohio yeah i think yeah i not really sure i know they re from ireland that all i know yeah my grandfather die um dead and my grandma still alive right now she loves my son yeah he seven months he seven months yep he climbing on stuff and everything um hum crazy not not yet not i mean he he he ll pull himself up on tables and he ll like turn around like hey check this out and then he ll let go and fall on his butt it kind of funny kind of he he kind of yknow stumble foot still yknow one and then it yknow i can wait till mine crawling and or walking and all that and i can take you to places and you don have to carry him you can hold his hand it great because he heavy he killing my back oh yeah that what everyone said you think um i go to north land high school right now um i a senior i gonna get done with this i swear it hard it very hard i mean i missed a lot of school i mean and most people would think that i have a lot of help but i really don mean i live with my parents and everything and i mean they have jobs too it not like yknow when he up at night i i hafta do it my responsibility now and i mean people think that yknow oh you get a lot of help no they have their lives i have mine um we re using his aunt right now i mean she stays home with her daughter and she got one on the way and so she watches him while i in school it not a long period of time i only there till ten clock yeah i mean i can practically graduate already i have all the credits but then you have those required classes that you hafta take so yeah that it i get wick that is it um i have a class at um high school that it called grads and it like um yknow all the kids in there are people that have kids or that are having kids and i mean we talk about that all we do is sit in there and talk about our kids and what they re doing and how our parents and them reacted like there was this girl that just got in there today and and her parents were flipping out because she pregnant and um we were telling we were all telling her about how yknow um it it always starts out that way and they ll ease up later on yeah and the one girl had um showed her their ul her ultra sound and then that when it was like ah it so cute and like well wait a minute i thought you was against it they re not always against it though yeah it my baby and then oh you re having a baby that i don want to let you go syndrome um figures everyone loses their funding hum hum oh yeah oh no we just had a whole conversation come on now oh okay it doesn have like the equalizer thingy oh it does yeah my boyfriend would love to mess with this i just want you to know that he be like taking it apart putting it back together uh it sucked no it sucked i mean i i don have it like my sister she puking every day mean she gets up she gets up it wakes her up at five clock and she does it all day i never i never puked not once i was but it was like the feeling like i hungry right now thi that bothered me because i wasn like a real heavy eater and then all of a sudden it like i want to eat that and that and that get me this and oh it was crazy it was weird yeah i mean i didn have back problems or anything like that but it was just like the feeling it was like i not right oh i hafta eat it that like they it and they alway what made me mad about it is because everyone always thinks you re mad at them and oh she snapping she pregnant back off yknow it like i just saying yknow yeah oh yeah i was ready oh yeah it like let go come on well yeah because uh i would ve had lots of epidural because they induced me because my doctor said hey it time we can do this so i got it lucky even though i kind of wanted it ta have it yknow normal and um yknow to look at him and go oh my water broke oh no and watch him flip out yknow like on movies but um he di i we we we didn get to do that so and like just through the first three hours and you don really start to feel it and and then you really do and i was that little pain that i did feel my mom like oh try doing it the whole time yknow and it i was crying the whole time just that little pain my mom was laughing at me it wasn funny and to what they left out parts yknow if you talk to people when they have babies and they oh it the worst pain but you ll forget about it they left out that whole part where they put the epidural in you and you you puke up yknow you left that part out totally left that part out no one filled me in about no throwing up or anything that that really made me leaving out stuff man oh yeah i mean to me you re supposed to earn your grade it always been my feeling and and uh i try to be fair in the way i grade uh you know it i try to be as objective as i can sometimes i because i think it important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an essay or short short uh essay for for a test and um but the way that i would grade those would be pretty i you know i come up with a rubric and i say you you need to have you need to mention certain things i ll give certain your things yeah i ve i ve never been a i been a teacher where whose had to assign or grade writing i not sure i would know how to do yeah right right um hum right right right well when i was teaching taking teacher classes here um and classroom teachers um they would always tell me you need to give a grade for class that was always too subjective for i i could not see myself doing that and and you know how am i going to tell who yknow trying to butter me up by raising their hand and and asking questions um i uh yknow i could i just couldn see doing and i was i had enough to worry about and think about when i was trying to teach in keep everything else straight and also mark down if people are participating uh that was tough i ended up not doing it um hum subjective right right bump i know i know i know well it good to have that i think it would be good to have that leeway but i not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of um not cutting down the ones i didn like that much yeah yeah um hum um hum right right right right i think teaching band might be fun because i think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there whether you were well behaved yeah and whether you re trying to play your instrument i i don think we ever got a and yeah um hum right the competition you played saxophone in the band um hum yeah do you have one now uh huh oh that good that good well i can tell you some community bands that could use you yeah yeah well um the one that um god shawn in yeah uh huh um uh we don have enough saxophones sure we could use you huh oh well we re having like three concerts the next month right right right right um hum um hum i i like playing that band mostly because the director is he a his dad is teaches trumpet here at ohio state and he is uh he likes to challenge us uh and it not so much in the summer in the summer we end up playing marches and stuff that popular favorites right right but during the rest of the year a lot of times we really really um challenging and interesting band music and you don always get the opportunity to do that in uh musical groups yeah sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator of what they expect the audience to want to hear well i play actually in two orchestras and uh symphony and in the orchestra which is an all amateur group but uh it it actually there were uh when i was i ve been in that group for maybe seven or eight years now there have been times when i ve been in group that have i have thought it had a really wretched sound because they don have auditions they just take anybody that wants to play and if you take a string player that can play in tune it can really wreck everything yeah but uh i think we ve improved a lot uh we we gave a concert uh a couple weeks ago at a church in upper arlington and uh i thought it went pretty well one piece a little bit of mozart uh some concertos so that was fun yeah well it depends i think i like to do new stuff but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites um in the symphony um unfortunately they tend to have budget problems um because a lot of the people in that group are paid um um hum i get i get paid it kind of semi professional ae aspect thing where you get paid per service but um let see so they have to uh balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for with the amount of music that they want to do and uh this last year we played a movement of the shuman concert piece for four horns and orchestra and i was a little bit flabbergasted when i saw that on the schedule at the beginning of the year because it really to play and i thought is he expecting us to play this the solos or is he expecting to bring in somebody well as it turned out he expected us to play the solos or didn play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and um i thought it came out pretty well i have a recording of it for a while there i was worried that we didn get a recording of it and i was really upset yeah just one concert i know i know that why you have to get it recorded it would be nice to have more than one concert but uh they they just they re on a shoestring they really are they get most of their money i think by well if you count in kind contribution the eh er uh otterbein college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space and uh salary the conductor uh so that a huge an amount of money they put into it what we have to give in return is an opportunity for to play so uh sometimes we have uw college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they don have a college orchestra uh but once in a while we ll get wind players play in it also and um sometimes leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something you wanted to play but most the time it not it not bad um so there there that it an opportunity for the musicians in the college to play in an orchestra and and what else do they get out of it i don know prestige a suppose yeah they don get i don think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council and they they raise money from the businesses the community we charge for tickets for people to come and see us and sometimes it sometimes we get a lot sometimes we don get so many turns out the concerts we get the most the biggest audience for are the christmas concerts where we have children because yes yeah right you can get a there um they just got different beliefs she believes a i mean like one thing she believes all men will cheat yes she believes all men will cheat she believes no man will love you so much not to cheat and i don believe that so i not with her son because i i mean that must be how she raised her kids yknow and she um and that what i asked her she got a husband i like so your husband you believe he cheats yeah and i don believe that i think that terrible i mean most men are dogs yeah but i do believe if yknow when you re in love and you love somebody you will not ch you will not cheat on them yeah yeah um hum oh that so nice yep yeah yeah um i sure yeah i mean i she he doesn throw women in her face no women call the house or anything yknow uh you never know what she doesn yknow question him about where he been or anything like that and i she just i just can believe that i just think that terrible yeah she got she got a lot of kids there um three boys and like four girls yeah maybe maybe because she says aw us americans are different than than they were raised and they are but i told her i yknow there isn i will never be married if my man gonna be cheating on me i won marry him um hum yep no it hapden quite a few times and that i mean i also cheated on him too yknow we both did it but um it once i had my son i was ready to settle down i not yknow i wasn going for that stuff no more and he still wanted to do that yknow and lie and cheat make up stories and and he still does it i don and and i don understand why i feel like he a grown man if he was out don make up a story and his mother also make yknow they re just it just it very stressful for me and and i that another another reason why i don want my son going there for yknow much longer um but his dad pays pays her for the because i can afford it yeah and he got control over that because i i mean he was going to a different babysitter a woman um that baby sits and she would did very very well she did all that stuff that i would like to be done she took him to the library she had nap time at a certain time and they were and yknow lay down and it just totally different a uh at the grandmother um hum yeah no no hum um yeah uh i don think he spends with him like that yknow he sees him at his mom house and yknow will come by and see him at my house but i try to um put a i don know because we seem to argue a lot yknow and i don like to for my kid to see that so i try i try to do the best thing for my son um hum yeah like when i need things and i call him up i need diapers i need wipes i need twenty dollars yeah he there for me the there for that financially yeah he always been there for me um hopefully it well it kind of hard he see he got two other kids and one kid he had while we was together that he does not see at all because the mother um he played her because he was with me and yknow if and she just was like forget him i don want him to be around my child and the other one she a older she they she like ten and um he says that because his daughter don call he only ca she only calls for when she wants things so he doesn yknow he ll he ll get whatever he can for her when she calls but he doesn spend time with her it so i just see a pattern yknow i just feel like this is gonna happen to me eventually well i i i just hope he stays arou i i i don know maybe not but i grew up without a father and i really um have that against my father because he lived around us he never called us yknow it and now i ve really got resentment against him i mean as old as i am i still got that against him and that what i i want my yknow my son to keep i want him to know his dn dad father and be around him even though he not the best best of person but yknow i ll raise him the best way i can yes hopefully yeah because i ve thought about that like well maybe i ll just wait a few years and start dating um hum oh i see yep so the the original father didn wasn around for the kids oh that sad see i don want that to happen to me because i just that um i mean i had a guy that i did start dating when my son was a baby but um it just he got he fell in love with me i mean he wanted us to be together he wanted us to have a house he wanted to have my kid have his last name and i was like are you crazy this child is somebody else yknow kid not yours and he didn he he didn like that he loved my son yknow and we re still good friends and he still comes sees my son but i couldn hum um hum um unless yknow his dad was totally gone but he been there ever since yknow i was pregnant all through my pregnancy and he been there for his whole two years i wouldn do that to him his last name he got his first name too no i gave him um middle different middle name i didn like his la middle you re going oh you didn yeah yeah my mom didn like that she said when they go to school you re gonna have they re gonna have different last name than you i like so what i don care i hate my my last name is terrible i hate my last name um hum redden i don know why that was but it sounds like it i guess and yeah i was called a lot of little things no yeah i mean i tried and tried i just see it that he not changing i and i yknow you keep hoping he you just keep hoping but it all upon him and obviously he doesn love me enough to really want to change and settle down he still wants to do those things he doing and i just need to move on hum um no yeah um media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that to get them thinking about it then they ll start to notice it in their life and once they start noticing it they ll start getting more and more into it no humans are violent by nature i believe mean people have been at war since the beginning of man it it more or less greed that causes violence it not media media just like the ecstasy was an advertisement showing what you could do tv showing you violence that you could do if you re driven to it i know i don i i guess it just over the course of the year everything balances out so um hum uh until they start getting a little bit better equipment because the equipment is really ancient i mean there stuff there that older than i am so but they like uh port columbus is getting a new tower and they re it supposed be done in about three and a half years and the equipment they re getting is all brand new stuff it not like they re taking all the old junk we ve got and moving it over there so yknow that will help and and nationwide they re also putting new stuff in but the bad part is is um picture your father is your father computer literate okay he he at his job and tomorrow morning they come in and they go everybody gonna put all their work on computer well his speed was like say seventy mile an hour before and now it gonna be twenty because he doesn know how to do it and that the problem they re running into they have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes and how to get them in trail and yknow everything but now they ve gotta do this extra part which is going to make their job easier down the road but everybody hates change so what they re doing now is it they re having problems because people can take the volume of airplanes because they re trying to keep up with the computer so it making it even slower yet but once they get in yknow in the swing of things it ll be okay but yknow you re you re talking a while yknow because it not something that you can do overnight but it be like your dad learning the computer he not going to do it overnight and right and if he if he open minded enough to do it eventually he ll see the light and say boy this would make it a lot easier but there are people who are like i will not do this yknow so those the ones that hafta be drug screaming and kicking right um hum right um hum there a lot of uh money money in town here and there sometimes like you ll see a uh one entire airplane that goes to cancun and it like people are going on vacation or people who are gonna go gambling in jamaica that all it is so then when that comes in we have these really weird painted airplanes and we re like who is that and they ll go that transmeridian and we go write that down because i don know that name yknow so um hum um hum right i the accents sometimes but uh they they uh they re okay i mean no bi no big problem but uh the the accent sometime it like um there sort of a uh running joke i don know if i should say this but it like if i can talk like and uh talk all the time like this why is it that they can talk like we do yknow it like yknow if i could if i could talk that way we ha do have pilots that do talk like and sometimes it even easier to understand them because their they enunciate so well but uh yknow it that something we ve never understood yknow if we can fake that accent why can they fake ours to make it easier for us to understand but yknow but no usually there no problem the only problem you usually have is like somebody like yourself who has never flown and is taking lessons and you you have about ten or fifteen hours and we tell you to do something and you like um well i think i know what they mean so i ll just keep flying and it that the worst thing you can do the best thing to do is say okay i heard what you said but i brand new at this and i ve got no idea what you mean can you try it again and they ll go okay now we know where you re coming from and they ll make it really easy for you because if they just yknow yknow zoom out some phraseology and you go nine eight juliet which is the wh how you respond with a call signing the airplane they go she got it and they go on to the next guy and then all a sudden you re going off this way and they go uh six nine juliet uh where are you going and you re like uh i uh told me to and then they go oh brother yknow so now yknow the attention is diverted to you so that usually what the problem is because most pilots are there are really professional yeah um hum oh understanding yeah um hum we don really have that much yknow the foreign ones um it it probably be like maybe two or three percent of our total pilot yeah um hum right no um i used to be a charter pilot and a flight instructor and i used to go to work at like eight clock in the morning and get home for my first meal with johnny carson and i did this six days a week and to get my my one day off i would get up at like at seven clock get in my car and drive to the mall and park and sleep in my car because i i didn own a telephone because i couldn afford one and and also i thought if i had one they ll call me well they would come yknow if i didn get up that time on my day off they come knocking at the door and say we need you to come for a trip so yknow one day um it was a really bad day i gone to like tulsa oklahoma with somebody and came back and yknow i like i said i hadn had anything to eat the entire day and uh it was like it was like midnight and i got home and i thought oh i too hungry yknow to i too tired and hungry and i just thought uh i not making anything so i just went to bed and uh a guy knocked on my door which he lived upstairs in the apartment above me and he tell me are you in there and i wouldn answer well it was a real cheap apartment he took a credit card and punched the uh the door knob and opened it up and it grabbed on the chain and he reached in and flipped the lights on and he goes do you hear me and i go yeah and he goes you got a trip be out the airport at four thirty and i go ah he says you hear me and i go yeah uh yeah he goes well get some sleep and he turns the lights off pulls the door shut and uh i laying there and i like i ve been home like three hours and now i just fuming and i thought i know a college education doesn guarantee you financial security but i thought what am i doing working yknow from dust i mean dawn to way past dusk six days a week and making nothing and having people like this come tell me you gotta go to work tomorrow so i went upstairs and knocked on his door and told him i quit and uh he wasn very thrilled about that but one of my students was a uh controller and uh he came and talked to me and he says uh he says i know i heard you quit he says i want to tell you about my job and he was a controller at owensboro kentucky and uh he said he worked forty hours a week and i go well i usually do that by wednesday and he said that he had uh annual leave and sick leave and i said what are and he said that he had a health plan and i said what is that and i he said he had insurance life insurance and i go what is that so he goes yknow we really need to get you over here so that how i i went and took the test and started that way well actually anybody can try yknow there is a civil service exam you hafta take and they place you on a list from that and like say if you have an eighty well everybody that takes it after you that gets an eighty one is gonna get hired before you do uh so you can take it again but if you score lower you gotta keep that lower score so and that sometimes people are yknow kind of apprehensive about doing that but uh once you pass that and then they say yknow the government goes okay we re ready to hire a thousand people throughout the united states well each region there regions in the united states they may get like thirty for the great lakes region so they go down the list the first thirty and they call yknow they write each one of them and say we re offering you a position yknow do you want it or not and yknow some the people have said well i ve been on the list for two years and i have a yknow like you i have a job and i don want it now yknow so and then those people hafta go to oklahoma city to the academy and go through a screening program which is really hard because at one time only forty percent of the people were making it through that yeah so it it a really tough thing to do i mean you hafta be sort of organized and i don know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an air traffic controller who couldn you be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor th i mean there are people who do this job who i mean are not stupid but they re not college educated and really intelligent but they re extreme good at it and then the other people uh that i know of one that i work with every on a regular basis he is got a masters degree and he yknow he reads continuously he always up i mean if you ask him anything about like what going on on overseas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he one of our weakest ones yknow and it um right and and also the other thing is you ha you hafta be sort of compassionate because like yknow you re you re working a lot of airplanes and you re wanting answers like this when you spiut something out you want an answer yknow th each airplane is supposed to respond with their call sign like if i tell somebody yknow turn left heading three six zero and he supposed to respond a three ninety six roger well if he doesn respond then i ve got to say it again which means instead of ten airplanes i now have eleven i talking to because i hafta tell them talk to them two times each so yknow there are some people that get really mad quick because they want that answer like that where yknow i was a pilot so sometimes i thinking yknow yes um undergraduate student first year finishing it up oh yeah oh it definitely the the beginning the beginning of the end yep um grew up in upper arlington not far yeah really those five miles make such a difference though like because i yeah because i live on campus yeah i live in uh siebert hall oh yeah i got i think there are a hundred and seventy of us here for just from my class alone uh four twenty five yeah it been like that every year basically yeah it usually like about a third or something i think maybe two thirds of them live on campus it just basically getting out of the house just to get away from my parents for a while yknow and it kind of good for me just to be away it part of the experience like learning do my own laundry and stuff i used so bad about it and now all of a sudden i don care really i i don care about like having to do it like my mom even wants me to do hers over summer i like okay fine yeah i think so um met quite a few people from cleveland and then my roommate is from north canton no not really um all my good friends from well i say like out of all my good friends from high school one of them no two of them are still here um i do so much just not uh one of them i see just got back from lunch with i mean i see him every day the other one i don see that much anymore um well she got a boyfriend so she busy and she lives off campus too so she lives out in hilliard actually it far um hum yeah she had an apartment in arlington and so they wanted to get an actual house so they built one out in hilliard yeah she still lives with family um um um huh um well the opinion kind of like the general consensus around upper arlington is that is not a good enough school for everybody so you ve you want to go to ivy league you don even want to look here yknow so they offered to accept me to med school here okay i ll stay yeah i in a uh in the guinea pig class of this program through the medical school where after three years of undergrad i go to med school here like without cats or anything um i get a which they mail to me after first year of medical school like they figure that uh gross anatomy and all that enough biology experience actually i do wasn even that sure that i wanted to do it until um like senior year and the opportunity came up and i said to her oh this sounds cool yknow i had thought of myself as a uh a chemist for a long time and that this opportunity came up yeah i applied to like other places and i got into university of chicago and i wanted to go there and then this came up here and also i mean it just ridiculously cheaper here i didn want debt after that just pathetic um my counselor just kind of found it and he posted it and he specially um tried to notify the national merit people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of them is at princeton right now yknow and they re all off at their ivy leagues like basically working their butts off to get in when i already in i don totally understand it yeah ohio state is like a really good medical school i don i don know i think they just mainly didn want to go to like their egos or something yknow i thinking of one in particular yknow rich parents just wanted to go somewhere else yeah he they could afford to go there so they did i think um the people who have already graduated they re like the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults it just that the kids want to go it it just thought of as a somewhat party school i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is but within the honors program i think there some really really exceptional things going on yeah um one of the requirements is we have to been in the honors college during undergraduate and fulfill all the requirements there um you get priority for scheduling you have to apply for it like seperately and i think you have to have like certain um class standing and a scores or you can write an essay and they ll let you in anyways um let see you get priority for scheduling the i think you go after varsity athletes and disabilities and that it yeah i think they do yeah they do um let see you have to complete either a thesis or a contract which just consists of taking lots of honors classes and they have honors classes which are separate and they re supposed to be with like better faculty and um smaller class size and a little more challenging my honor class is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging but no it not it regular enough for me in that and i didn have i couldn schedule the honors yes they do uh i almost think the honors would be better just because of smaller class size i have like four hundred in my class right now but it kind of helps actually because uh you have all the people in there who are not honors and they don know how to like the partiers they don know how to study or anything so yknow it helps the curve yeah i have to take organic i have to take um biology chemistry physics and then um i have to complete a major if it biology i get a break i don uh i only have to take twenty nine hours of it but other ones you have take the full major yknow some people are doing uh gosh i think one doing business and one doing economics and i think they re doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided to take the easy road hm um early admission pathway um hum there fifteen yeah um the medical school has pretty much limited them to ten percent of the we try and yknow we try and and teach and expand people knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about christ they don have yknow they don have that blank look on their face when the person asks them something yknow they somebody asks them something and they re like yknow i don know or they actually have an answer yknow i if i and if they don know they ll say i don know but i can find out for you if you re willing to if you re willing to give me the time to go find out i don know the hardest um some of the really hard questions um why do bad things happen to good people people can people can just accept that that bad things happen to good people they want to know why i don know why i not i me i mean yeah i have a personal relationship with my with my god but we re not on yknow we re not on a conversational i on this side of the table you re on that side the table why did this happen and he doesn he doesn see fit to tell me why something happens unless it pertains to me um let see what another really hard one um one of the biggest ones with people my age is the de is um apologetics uh ver apologetics which is going out and saying you re a sinner accept christ everybody on this campus has heard of brother jedd he runs around on cam he runs around on the oval going yknow slut whore yadda yadda yadda and that just the i mean there are a lot of there are a lot of people within the community of of christians who can stand that we don like what he doing because yeah i one of them because we have to go back anyone who has been influenced by him we have to go back and we have to undo all the damage he done before we can really start in on them and and and helping them to understand what we re trying to tell them we have to undo what brother jedd has done because he just i mean yeah maybe his heart in the right place but he doing it the wrong way but um one of the big things is right after you re done speaking doing all of the spiel about yknow why you think they should ac accept christ in their life they say okay that good for you and that the general that the general feeling among people our age our generation i mean i mean what generation are we anyways i i twe i twenty so there like the generation they re the generation right after me and there generation two they re generation right before me so we re stuck right in the middle don even think we have a generation just one big yeah yeah yeah i don feel that i i don feel i i don feel like i fit in with the teenagers anymore either um hum yeah can really take her with you yeah you can get her in you can get her in have to be eighteen to get into dance clubs now but um that uh those are the two really really really tough ones that a lot of people will uh will will throw at you when you re when you re trying to share things with them but there i mean there whole there whole lists of them and uh it just a matter of i mean i i don kn i am getting myself to a point where i can go out and share my faith with other people i don think i ready to um because one of the biggest problems is like i mentioned with with the brother jedd thing is undoing the damage other people have done and i don have enough knowledge up here to really go out and and yknow to go out and be like a campus preacher i mean i will tell i will share my faith with people that i really close to that like yknow coemployees and other and other thing and other people that i in like if somebody and i if somebody gets real close to me in a class yknow eventually i ll share and eventually i ll share with them but like if i in a lecture hall i not gonna jump up and start hollering about my faith um and and i won i won walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people i don feel i ready to do that yet i think there are pla i think there a place and a time for doing certain things like um and this is this is one of the biggest um things that people use as as a reason for faith faith is something that people don understand i don even understand it i use it as i use it as an answer for a lot of questions that i don have answers for is faith and that what religion is religion is faith every religion has hasta have faith you hafta believe that what you re doing and what you re believing in is right yknow whether everyone else in the world thinks it is or not you hafta believe it is or you being or you being part of that religion has absolutely no meaning and that an answer that a lot of people don like to hear and yknow like um i ve walked down like high street before and gotten this urge this feeling to just share my faith with certain people on the on the sidewalks like i share i shared my faith fe uh a little while ago with some street bums and they were real receptive and i don know if they were drunk but they were real receptive i mean i i don know if they really understood what i was saying but i felt led to talk to them and that what i believe my faith is my faith is is faith it believing that things happen that you can explain and there it believing that uh you re doing what you re doing is right so religion a real big part of my life i knew we i knew we wouldn go into this tonversation too far before this before it came in um hum yeah it has it has yeah exactly what you said i mean my dad my whole family are christians and before i left for college my freshman year my dad my dad knows me real well mainly because i doing almost a mirror image of what he did when he grew up uh aside from the faith that i have um i very much like him um he wrote out a list of seven things sevem predictions for william freshman year and every single one of them was accurate it was really really really funny william will lose something expensive by the end of the year and had my bike stolen william will william will hi and the big one that i was gonna mention was william will either grow in his faith significantly or will go the exact opposite direction and i knew one or the other would happen because i the ty i mean my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh yeah it was real fun real fun i discreetly got him kicked out of the dorm he still doesn know it was me but yeah he still doesn know it was me but he and i are still on speaking terms which is which is fascinating um but uh yknow i mean our first day i walked in he said hey i tom you ever smoked pot before i was like no he said heck we got a whole year together and and i directly quoting that this the first thing he said to me that is the first thing he said to me no no he not but um he and i uh he and i hung out a lot and yknow i knew that one of two things was going happen i was gonna follow him and start doing all sorts of interesting and wrong things within my own mind doing them every time i doing every time i would have done them i would have known they were wrong or i was going to the opposite direction and i went the opposite direction i got plugged in with uh the some christian groups on campus made some christian friends and hung out with them and and grew a lot grew a lot in acceptance of other people i mean you don really run into homosexuals in a small rural christian community and if you do they if you do you don know it because they ll beget become shunned out of the community so fast that it crazy but uh um where was i going with that okay if you weren here well he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in ah twenty or twenty five years or something like that and he killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed and i thought that a cop out if there ever was one just to give him a lethal injection and let him go he should have rotted in prison for no that not a punishment he was off his rocker there isn anybody who murders who isn insane yknow technically there insanity and there isn insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who isn insane and uh just to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt and um um so i got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it and the other side is if we keep uh i a i believe in the ca cause uh law uh reincarnation and the law of cause and effect and if a person murders somebody they need they ll they will pay for that later there no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their um their guilt and what they ve done and and a lot of them don they say that hardened criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to um hum hum um hum yeah who well what um what my opinion on our whole penal system is just yknow well it goes along with not i kind of neglecting the kids in our schools tright now and we re definitely ne neglecting criminals they need to have be educated and and worked with i mean they need to obviously they some place some point they ve uh learned incorrect reasoning or whatever you call it and and they need to uh they need to have psychological help period yeah um hum yeah yeah that where we are in our evolution on this there a lot we need to do a lot of evolving we do um hum hum i don know uh in we i don uh for a while we got it stopped the thing that is uh confusing to me is that sometimes we ll get something stopped for twenty five or thirty years or ten or fifteen and then we go back it like hey we got moved ourselves out of that why are we going back to it now um and and i think yknow the papers keep saying that our cri uh crime rate is going down and everything and so uh i think that because we some people are yknow trying to make it deal with these people as people the who are ill or are sick and try to help them with their you yknow it took us a long time to figure out that alcoholism is a disease okay and uh so now we try to help a alcoholics well well ug certainly murdering is dis serious illness that needs to helped not yknow um well stick them in a place where they can just concentrate on it even more so we got a long ways to go there yeah um yeah yeah anger it always anger well i ll have a maybe when i i a hundred i ll have that figured out because i went to oregon and of course uh the greater part of the population out there are more socialists than they are capitalists and they re easier to deal with and they re more reasonable people in my opinion much more but then i come back to columbus and all my family and and and all i the minority in my family believe and uh they re very in to capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so so um it seems the picture is kind of hard to deal with people that are in to capitalism have a pretty good lives and they have what they want and they don uh seem to have such serious problems so people who try to go against that current can get it theirselves into big trouble so and capitalism has made the united states go i mean it has worked uh and we are ahead of the world there no question about that and what the individual people persons have and how their lives go much better on the other hand um yknow i i actually what i would like fo uh if it would just spread all over the world true communism true communism not as it was practiced in russia but uh where people um share and uh share power and share money and equally but with the where we are in our evolution that we re not ready for it i actually i lib when i was in oregon i did a lot of experimenting and i lived in an intentional community which was actually trying uh to di we never used the word but um i sure plenty of people used the word on us you but we tr uh we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true uh sharing but um in terms of government i don we weren ready for that because we had more of a matriarchy one woman who was decisive and made decisions and we would go along with her but um if a if a we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be great and i would very mu and i then in the year that i lived in that community was one of the best years of my life it was um the reason that it was one of the best years of my life is it in a incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was mostly of course young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers in um i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions as a matter of fact the that only thing i felten difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and i would trying to do the dishes or something mundane that it like i don want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions school board they re always stopping something and they don seem to move forward very well i don i don know if that what percolates it it very different in the public schools the catholic school the public school you have all the problems of society school you have the drugs you have the absentee you have the delinquency in the catholic school they just you don have that for one thing uh ya know it oriented around the church even though we re not catholic it still oriented as so there lot of values that permeates everything well they don do that in the public school because if you do that somebody gonna get ticked off it the wrong value and why are you doing this to my kid um so i think that missing that a problem within the school the public schools uh so just seems to be more distraction from the educational process know mean when you re in the catholic school and you re in classroom they deal with the discipline if they need to course part the way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them back to the uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think it harder for the teachers to teach cause there too much stuff in the way of they really they re there to do i don know i hadn thought about that uh i don no i don i don get the impression the values as anything to do with what they re doing in the school well i get the sense that if there are discipline problems it so hard to get anything done solve them unless you unless somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school ya know that the big thing now but just that ya know it just so hard to get anything um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they don see the support throughout through the administration and if they do have they have to wait til something pretty pretty egregious before they before it dealt with yeah they re error prevented from doing much yeah yeah i yeah i just don think that they can do much and i i sure it very frustrating for them well and i know it is we got friend who was a teacher she just retired a couple years ago she about our age and uh it it very different now uh you know it she said it scary going into the classroom sometimes uh and before it wasn that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a know go and get something dealt with it now you can get backing on it no and she said ya know and and the the last three or four years she just rode it out so she could retire and she used be very dedicated uh very dedicated teacher she just it was a job then and i hate see that happen to good teachers right right when it just frustration after frustration yeah that yeah but i don see that in the catholic school now in the catholic school they re not even paid as well as the public schools but the environment is better for education no well my son yeah i son started public school for kindergarten and he just my son is my son is a very social child we ll say he he the one that talks too much as the teachers say he the social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured i mean he needs time to run around but he needs something very structured you get him near a bunch of other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them cause he was ready to play well yeah and yeah my and my my daughter the opposite that uh but he would do that and so he wasn he was very he wasn learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble it was like i i don know we would be told he was a problem but he didn understand what was going on and it wasn there wasn structure he would go to school everyday and not know what to expect because there wasn like this we ll do this and then we ll do this and we ll do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better better match for him and then error my daughter went to school was just easier to take them to the same school and that goes back reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about why the discipline and and behavior may be different in the catholic school is you re paying big you re paying bucks yknow it four forty five hundred dollars a year for us to send her to school uh and if we find out she not doing her work it very different uh yeah so i think she getting a better education than he did but it because she doing the work and and she knows she expected to has to and he my son the kind he rather play than work and so he he rode a lot and and he and he paid for it when he got to college it was rough for him to start out because he was behind then no mean oh they have religion they have a religion class they have religion everyday but some of it is just starting with prayer and bible stories and some it more the values uh lot those teachers aren catholic which ahvah i i was surprised to hear that uh in fact the religion teacher that my daughter had in ninth grade she had religion class everyday wasn catholic yeah i thought that was interesting uh so it is a values yknow the the christian values thing uh i don have problem with we had little problems like my son had to learn the hail mary and we had to find somebody to teach it to us write it down for us because we didn know and they wrote it down wrong so he learned it wrong and he got marks off and we and we didn yeah little things like that but it wasn a problem uh there was a problem with my son for a while because the priest they had there wouldn let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion and that pretty much the priest decides that and he and he felt singled out and he was i mean he was the only one and he was uncomfortable with that uh but it hasn been a problem uh i not a religious person myself but i not against it and if i maybe i ve justified it to myself by saying well they re teaching values no well he right now he really interested in eastern religions i not sure where that came from yknow when they go to college and they re gone and you don see them much uh that what he interested in right now so i don think it it it it really took right error and if my daughter doesn seem ah yeah yeah we have talked about some things that are yknow the pope says this is what is and knowing full well that this is not what we think at home we abortion and homosexuals and we re fwer if much more liberal than that and yeah clipping it that where there been a problem but we re very open about that at home clipping and with my daughter is strong willed well no she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade but she doesn believe it yeah yeah she very pragmatic yeah i mean she could probably well she she interested in physical therapy is that what your wife is oh and so you had physical therapist did it yeah but it fixed it yeah drugs right yeah so that what she interested in right now she looking to see if she can find someplace to work this summer even if it just a day a week some clinic or something just to to see whats goes on day to day why that really you mean instead of a doctor it like oh well i haven read enough to know i i saw uh uh uh preliminary thing that they were going to protest and uh but i don a i not informed enough to give an opinion on i don i i that mi might i think that that what they were protesting was that they weren ge being i involved in it wasn that part of their protest they weren being represented i don know i ll have to read i didn read paper yet no did you it probably because put your ad it was in the paper in the summer when we weren doing anything and wanted something to now we re busy oh i have just the same opinion i think most people have as the tv i mean i i i mean that probably can be proven i don know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that yknow it would be the influence of tv yknow the and then and another thing that well tv is the in uh where it comes from but like the kids are all into pokemon right now and it uh they have these fads that go through and somebody asked me my opinion about the pokemon i said oh brother yknow it couldn be any worse than what was those turtles that lived in the ni ninja well the kids went into that just so intensivel and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean what uh the visual was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these masks and hoods and and they fought a lot and there was lot of violence and then i love walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i i swear i haven seen a walt disney movie that doesn have violence in it i mean just like beauty and the beast there extreme amount of violence in there uh yknow just every one there a a bad dark side in the story so children just are su and i mean it in their the and then including my own daughter she and i swear i had her watch mister rogers all the but sh now that she older she watches tv she addicted to tv something terrible and then so of course her children are uh so but i think yknow i was i didn have tv when i was a child child and i think yknow it it stimulates the imagination in some ways but i don know what direction that imagination really goes yknow and but there a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody face anymore as matter of fact i getting so i don watch the news i dislike i can take any more of it i seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder it like the same thing over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it the yeah yknow yeah huh huh huh huh yeah you i ne uh i yknow i ve just come to i always you know prefer for my children and myself i mean uh if there anything disney i usually go and watch it yknow at the movie theater and after a while it like i think beauty and the beast is where it really came through to me it like that a wonderful story but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it and the way disney sells i think is they do have beautiful music but then i it like it some evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can stop and not watch that you you ca can and if i was in charge of it i cut some of it out it not that yeah yeah so yeah um hum yeah no asking each other opinions or anything like no kind of of um yknow uh it i it just seems like our uh society just has that you have to be just horrible to a person because they re bad well you and i know that a bad person doesn become better by being bad to them yknow what i mea it uh i mean we re i hope we re getting to the place we know that that uh we we don necessarily overcome bad by bad we re still very much in that framework of reference in this on this particular okay drooping down okay i ta bouncing around too much um hum yeah yeah okay um that our planet um hum hum hum yeah um yeah yes uh well i very much my baseline philosophy is thou shalt not kill and that goes really a long ways for me that includes uh being a vegetarian and uh um and uh most of our wars i would have let yet although on the other hand i i have to admit that there has been some stuff that we haven been able to stop without it um and na that and that too bad yknow that things things are have been that bad in some like oh world war two th the i mean we didn really have any choice there not that but uh some of the some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh so but yknow you can get you can get a philosophy but it doesn have always apply every single case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment the the guy that they um uh executed here in ohio last summer fall did you know about it you probably okay so how are you gonna help them when they re all over used to be you lived in a little neighborhood you knew all your neighbors you don have that now everybody is mobile they st had on the news most people keep the house five to seven years before they sell it and move on yeah yeah same i ve been in the same house for seventeen years and the only way i move is if the neighborhood went down and when i say went down i talking about way down i like where i at and i got good neighbors i think that influences how everybody behaves not only the kids the adults too well it well let put it this way i can go out and make money without even making money off the government agencies if i wanted to if i wanted to be a crook i could i could be a crook and uh i could have people rent me a house low income i could move in there i could do all kinds of stuff yknow to make money on the side all through the government uh that what i mean it it too easy to get away with stuff nowadays well let put this way if your kids are in my yard doing something and i yelled at them you re liable to come down to my house and either shoot me sue me or have me locked up right when i was a kid if neighbor yelled at me i better make damn sure he didn tell my dad because i would ve gotten my ass whipped nowadays you don have that yknow what are you going to you hit that kid you re going to jail yeah yeah well is it i had the same thing happen to my kid i smacked him one time yknow and it was in the butt going get me wrong he told me he was gonna have me uh locked up for child abuse so i threw his ass in the car and took him downtown and took him inside and told him to tell them people because they re gonna lock him up if i an unfit parent not me that put a stop to that right away uh about twelve because see i his stepfather and i ve heard the thing yknow you re not my real father and all that we went through all that that just like i told him take everything you got that your real father got you and you can hit the road if you want of course the only thing he had was nothing now i got him i got him sounds like i bought a dog but yknow what i mean when he was about nine years old but he known me all my life so yknow what i mean it wasn no big shock uh but see his father lived right around corner and never even had nothing to do with him but when he did have something to do with him it was kinda strange they would go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that and and yknow i was here i am in a predicament i can say nothing to them yknow that his real father so i gotta sit there and keep my mouth shut yeah none whatsoever he ll basic yeah he ll basically tell you he don have no except for me oh yeah yeah but see that was coming from his more than him yknow but of course whenever they needed a ride or anything like that they come to me yknow well it just the same as when i was a kid it whatever you gonna get away with yknow um hum yeah but fifty years ago if you had epilepsy they lock you in closet and throw away the key and wouldn let out most the parent i ve seen to me i rather see the kids with a step parent because i ve seen lot of bad parents i ve sh seen a lotta bad people you know what i mean i have people know you always about drugs and all that i ve seen people sitting there drinking you ask where their ki i don know he outside somewhere now those people don wanna take time nowadays it easier just to give a kid a beeper if you need them beep them then actually know where he going every kid that my kid ran around with i knew his parents one way or the other and yknow i show up at their house if i thought something was going on know yknow it don matter to me i just like said i grew up here in columbus ohio i just a dumb hillbilly like aw if they were having a party at somebody house and their parents didn know i up there asking what the hell was going on yknow no because them kids still stop at my house even though my kid is not there they ll stop by my house just to say hi and most kids don do that nowadays yknow well al also too when is the last time you seen a baseball game kids playing a baseball game in the neighborhood you don yeah what really weird is i can go over my mom neighborhood you ll still see kids playing out there in the school yard playing baseball now i got a school yard right next to me you come up there and you see no kids doing it sah it like each neighborhood got a little different i think that bullshit my dad was crippled for for nine months he was in a cast from his neck down to his ankles he had a hip fusion is what it was called back then they had no artificial hips he had one leg three inches shorter than the other and he had no hip joint whatsoever it was just ground up bone so my mom was working and uh ah this going to sound sickening i was years old i even have to come home from school and stick suppositories up him to take care of him i mean for twelve years old no offense when that dad that that ain the best to be going when you get off school you and it didn hurt me none yknow i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors know it your neighborhood your neighbors most kids don have nothing to do in their neighborhood even and how many empty lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had go carts we had mini bikes we had all that kind of stuff yknow ah ain no way in hell you have nowadays your kid be thrown in jail you be getting sued for not having insurance yknow it it society again is taking away everything from you yes and no uh when we were in boy scouts we got kicked out of it yknow what i mean we had more fun on our uh where i grew up i grew up like i said right over here on olentangy there used to be a pond over here at the cemetery we used to go there everyday or this is in the summer now we go down to uh river to go over there where dodridge is there used to be a bash recreation center with a miniature golf course and everything now what that industrial nuclearonics or something like that think about now you got the wetlands down there yknow where are kids gonna go no not like they used to the majority are the ones that don get the guidance at home that you re trying to reach ain gonna go to boy scouts basically what you need more is like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood where they can go everyday the way i look at it also when i was a kid like i said i started working two jobs when i was fourteen you can even find a job unless you re sixteen nowadays so it kinda hard you know what i mean to do a lotta things because they they they they they re saying you re still a kid but yet no big deal i comfortable i from columbus ohio i was born and raised in columbus uh i grew up on the east side of columbus graduated from high school i then started working for ohio state in nineteen seventy seven and have been there here for twenty four years um my family personally my parents uh my parents my father was born and raised in daytona beach my mother was born and raised in uh portsmouth ohio both of them are ohio state graduates my father was a a my mother was a school teacher but didn work at when we were kids actually they met at lazarus working at lazarus yeah they both were different yknow he was in oh yep they both worked during college i guess my dad was on the i bill after the war so that how he got in here had to work some part time work to get his degree um hum it just east broad street just franklin park conservatory um no actually now i live in hilliard and i have a wife been married thirteen years have two kids age five and seven both of them ones in second grade and the other ones still in daycare at ohio state university um hum mobile it is it a lot of work it really is she a a nurse and she works at the medical center in the breast cancer department she a nurse she worked here for twenty two years also got her degree at ohio state she grew up in dayton and then moved here to go to college and then stayed uh at ohio state after college we met at ohio state um yeah everything revolves around ohio state huh i worked when i first started working here i was working as an orderly in the operating room for ten years and she worked in the intensive care unit so only been in the maintenance area for maybe ten years also um i don know it just i don know it didn seem like it was heading anywhere and i wanted to start doing something that was more career oriented now i do a a for twenty two buildings in the northeast area do a lot of chillers and laser labs and chill water for uh different kinds of experiments they re doing in the chemistry departments and stuff like that so went to school through our technical school for it to get a degree in the uh a stuff oh yeah i like it everyday is different you have different problems everyday yknow and i like working with tools and fixing stuff so that uh come in handy but yeah from the yeah um actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off so didn make you feel as needed as you wanted to be maybe yknow yeah yknow we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went on strike and i think the bosses knew this was coming so a lot of the air conditioning was already running by then right yeah the middle of may is when they usually start most of this stuff heating cooling and ventilation uh hum um all of them the university is divided up in different areas and there a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas usually there are about twenty buildings or so ours is in the northeast area from wexner down through the oval to oh i don know about uh derby or so around in there and then on over to woodruff nope not my ar not my area if it hot in here you better call the north shop um hum because yeah yeah well that probably the roof right there so there was snow or something i ll bet yep hm control problems of course there always a leak somewhere yeah well it could be hot water they send out heat and hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant but about now they drain that it drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so they might have drained it and that why it quit hm yeah run quick put plastic up oh i don know it seemed like it a tough call because it very unusual situation here at ohio state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions you think of autoworkers you think of pipefitters you think of you don think of such a wide variety of people and that very hard to negotiate for anybody yknow when you re talking raises and lots of money like this which what they were going for and the majority of the people in the skilled trades aren real big participaters in the union yknow we just ride along and from what i ve seen over the twenty years i ve been here is it seemed that a lot of the union what they did was was keep the trouble maker employees around longer yknow and so we ve really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can work because they will take all the money you make crossing that lines so you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they ll take them to court and they ll yeah it against yeah it against the union contracts so you have just no no they take no they take the money whether you re in it or not you have no choice you have a choice as to whether you re a member or not but they still take the money and if you cross the line they ll take that money back so anybody that yeah yknow you re better off getting another job if it lasts for a long time i did some of that it tough to yknow columbus has a big yknow job market there everywhere you look there help wanted so but it tough to get a job where you can just walk in and start today or yknow tell him hey yknow the minute strike is over i gone and so that was kind of tough looking for that type of job so oh yeah three weeks of pay it cost yeah cost quite a bit of money but if you got some strike pay and this and that but it wasn a lot yknow two hundred dollars a week isn much at all so and when you have a and i mean two hundred dollars a week don pay my day care bill so so it gonna be tight for our family for a few months yknow to get back on no no i mean the money yknow the money is great yknow fine it the biggest raise they ve ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went out on strike was a better deal than what they ve really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people didn wanna be separated from the hospital they don think it fair yknow that you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so that kind of a sticky situation because they ve always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget and you know the hospital i can see where they re coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that and they re thirty five million in the hole because they bought east and all this but yknow it not the unions fault that they ran out the contract yknow and yknow so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the entrance wage is so low that it hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that yknow and they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever as far as but they re not willing to pay a lot of these people and yknow they think contracting is the way but you re always gonna have to have people here to because contractors just don drop what they re doing and show up today and a lot of times we have a job finished before they ve written up the work order i was just listening to music and i got little sidetracked from this uh tree across the way got destroyed by lightning i looked across and it started raining and wind was a little heavy rocking me back and forth like this i got up all the way looked around and said what the hell going on here turn on the radio and they said something about yknow a thunderstorm coming through and it ll be gone by twenty minutes or something and this truck man it felt like it was going to tip over i just i got out of there real fast and uh started walking down towards it about uh probably about a good twenty mile walk to where the nearest uh twenty four hour house of pancakes is you ever been down there the i hop i hop you hop and uh i got about maybe three miles down the road and a cop pulls up just searing rain i mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain it just coming down all over the place hail and lightning she pulls up she goes are you nuts what are you doing and i said uh i sorry am i walking too far out in the road and she goes no you re walking in the middle the tornado i looked at her said what shit man so she drove me all the way out of that county to next county where the pancake place is so she went out of her way and out of her jurisdiction with this southern hospitality just to get me out of the weather yeah man i don want to be over in the next county yknow driving in the middle of the sky yeah a couple people down there floating around under me that be great but uh what i was most worried about was all the uh all the equipment and stuff that was in the truck i mean there the two thousand pound forklift back there and you re not gonna just dodge that and uh the second tornado it wasn as bad i mean as we was driving up after he uh ripped me off and he said well i taking your sorry ass back to columbus and i said ok go for it and just sitting there smiling all the way up know knowing what he didn know we get to tennessee and uh yknow uh weather kind of bad there too i like hey man slow down yknow you don have any windshield wipers in the middle of this rainstorm yeah he just used that rain stuff yknow it just you it didn even matter because you look at the wall right there that pretty much all you seen you see tail lights as you passed people at side of the road we was the only people on the road i said man why are they pulled over like that there must be something going on he was oh we ain gonna worry about it right now i gonna get back up there three clock in the afternoon and i look over and there this big old white swirling cloud comes down it about two miles west of us i coming just out of out of my screws here i just going whoa dude man look there a tornado over there and right at that time big old pine tree got pushed across yknow it already been broken but it just got nonchalantly pushed across the freeway and he goes that not a tornado that fog man that too far away i said what i said are you kidding me i studied the weather and i know about it you re gonna tell me that fog pushed that two foot pine tree across the way i mean it was a thick tree too and uh we get up to the next gas station he fills up and i listen on the intercom they had news on there weather and stuff tornado warning in that county i turned around i said now see who the dumb ass here i said i bet you don even know how to spell cirrus cloud or cumulonimbus or whatever yknow and uh yknow he was pretty much pissed off the rest the way up there because uh i was right and that pretty much the way i felt the whole day because i was just smiling on the inside knowing oh yeah he mixture between forrest gump and archie bunker yeah oh yeah archie bunker meets fred flint stone there you go i can really put him in the category of forrest gump because forrest gump was great guy fastest sucker on those braces yeah i did too man it wasn at the time but you live and you live and you learn yeah i was thinking about putting my life on book but i don think they would make that many pages have a twenty thousand page book yknow ten yeah ten thousand would be introduction well it all started yeah i want to take up uh couple music courses and yknow get little further on that better my education than what it already is i don consider myself the dumbest person but i know i not the smartest yeah there uh there a girl at the store i was talking to and uh she saw um how i wrote my signature if you look right there she asked if i was a doctor but it just me yknow i told her i tried to tell her yknow i not in any kind of writing special program or anything like that i not a doctor that for damn sure driving a eighty five truck yknow she says something about uh you sure you re not a football player or something yknow you got that that that significant signature there going and i told her well that just my identification there you look on my license nobody can copy that you see where the a and is my last name you probably see it better now not that photo not that one but yeah it just certain things make person themselves yeah the voice the signature the fingerprints people have their own style of doing things i myself like watching football fishing working on stuff well there well there plenty of stuff yeah well it not like uh it not like sex it little bit safer but it kind of you just go out with your equipment and if you catch one you catch one if you don then you don but i ve caught plenty of dinners lunch breakfast all that what i like best about it is when you re out in the middle of he was being real helpful yknow with the uh being a support yknow my parents are very supportive but yknow it was just sickening that i when i sat down there and they just you know the bidding started at a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and actually they offered us twelve thousand dollars my attorney looked at him and said are you fucking nuts he said this guy had his head split open and it was your negligence so you know we ll we ll take that as an insult and don insult us any more or we ll go to trial um so my attorney jumped it back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollar i couldn take sitting there these guys going back and forth and what they thought i was worth even the arbitrator was an asshole um but uh that the way that system works that all they understand is money the lawyers the judges everybody that works in that system i don care who they are there isn an honest one in it i don care there isn an honest one in it they might think they are but once you expose yourself to corruption you take that in with you and sooner or later yknow all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service i guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there it such a bureaucracy it so corrupt they have two choices to stay in it and try or to succumb to all the things and ninety percent of them as you can see what happens in washington have succumbed yknow there a i don i don hear any of them raising hell about what really matters in this country yknow they all get uh side lined and side tracked by special private interests and that that the bottom line and it sad but there so i i choose not to involve myself in that as much as possible we ended up settling for yknow bout seventy thousand dollars and uh um it was just a hard decision to make yknow because i felt yknow a lot more shoulda come from that i mean in or joking around yknow i saw that adam sandler movie big daddy he got his foot run over by a cab and there was a line in there pardon me where he says uh well i got my foot run over by a cab and that cab was huge and the jury decided that one night of pain in the hospital was worth two hundred thousand dollars and i like yknow what hospital was that yknow where wh what yknow uh so a lot of the things you hear in movies and television about these multi million dollar lawsuits is a lie um even the lady that i mean sued mcdonald for spilling the coffee on herself because she put in her crotch with the lid off yknow uh uh there ought to be a common sense clause in law suits yknow i her own stupidity uh and you get the attorneys trying to argue that well mcdonalds coffee is hotter than every other coffee it like big deal yknow common sense it hot you don put it in a sensitive area while you re driving to work um but she sued for ten million and the papers said she won ten million she didn i mean after that ten million award was given by a jury then the uh mcdonald is allowed a an appeal at the end of a year so she doesn see any money for a year and that if they don appeal but ninety percent of these big corporations have the money behind them they have the lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal uh poor people can do that um after all is said and done with her case she was left with about a million dollars and then out of that million the attorney in the firm got a third plus she had to pay off his expenses so really she was probably left with only about three hundred thousand dollars which if used wisely okay maybe she could ve but it sounded to me like she didn have a money problem anyway she was a corporate person um but a very stupid person um so i mean that basically my my battle with the legal system i yknow i ve i ve got a person right now that owes me five hundred dollars that i wanted to take to small claims court i even got the ca uh the cancelled check to prove it and but yknow uh and when i look at what the alternative is which is subjecting myself to uh unfairness uh even though i feel i got a concrete no way yknow uh those are the ones that i mean i have to pay an attorney and the cheapest one i can find right now is a hundred forty five dollars an hour and nobody worth that you know so that what i saying it so retarded uh over th i don mean to use that word in a bad way but it ridiculous so just but it that i mean that better word uh that that people have to uh uh have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can afford the legal help so i think that wrong in this country the land of the free and the home of the brave yeah right yknow it land of the free all right yeah it free country but it ll cost you i don know uh this freedom semi quasi freedom there an illusion of freedom and a reality of freedom uh and the indian people know the big difference of that yknow so but that yknow i ended up settling the attorney got most the money what little i had i invested and then i made some bad investments when i went off my medication and uh yknow blew it yknow so that was my responsibility my fault but uh yknow how it was just years of pent up frustration and i just i spent it i spent it in a yknow unorthodox way but yknow well i had fun doing it uh won lie there uh lot of happy strippers in town so or i should say exotic dancers well something that i i wanted to get into some kind of counseling with people that had been through traumatic experiences but i need to be at a point where yknow i in my recovery where i know i won be sucked back down into their way of thinking um so it it a step by step process i i tried to go into counseling for chemical addictions yknow for alcohol and drugs but um the bullshit excuses i keep hearing from these addicts was just too much to take and even even the bullshit excuses from former addicts it was like uh give them a license to be a screw up yknow uh a lot of the nurses even who were former addicts yknow when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done they weren doing following protocol and of course me i be the one saying hey you re not following protocol and they say well yknow i a i a former addict i allowed to do that i said no you re not yknow yes and a and that so i i geared towards yknow with people with mental illness yknow they ve they ve diagnosed me with bipolar but yknow my neurologist says the bipolar was a just a chemical imbalance as a result of the brain injury um and spiritual leaders told me that uh it a spiritual imbalance there there really no uh chemical thing there there th the problem is a physical mental and spiritual with the majority of the problem is spiritual and when you talk to people that uh know that not believe it they know it i mean you talk to people in the catholic church about the unseen meaning the spiritual realm and they freak out yet they pray a prayer every sunday we believe in the seen and the unseen i ll never forget it because i recited it for god knows how many years but when you talk to them about possession when you talk to them about demons or spirits they freak out or they use the bible to say well yknow god specifically says in this chapter not to partake in spiritual activity well who do you think wrote that yknow who do you think wants to keep you from from doing something that ll help you because people this land and indigenous tribes all over the world they don follow the bible they ve done pretty damn good yknow and um it just the spirit spiritual aspect there is the realm even einstein the most brilliant man supposedly mathematically of our time ah even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yet but nobody has taken the time or made the time to challenge his theory yknow he says that equals squared i say it equals cubed because the world is three dimensional it not two dimensional uh two dimensional limits everything but you look at his theory of relativity all of our mathematical theorems physical theorems on physics and things of that nature have been based off that and they re not accurate those were the good old days that a good old day that when you used to own them too you could trade them that that when we lost our rights there are some things that are traditional that are capital and some are little little case and you re talking about little case i talking about capital oh yeah i think everybody should if nothing else you missed your boat by that time yeah yeah he has ah he hasn questioned me like that but i see a lot of things coming out he doing more in why he been doing things about more differently than my daughter cause my daughter was away at school and he with us everyday so he home every doesn wanna stay on campus uh and uh it he does things voluntarily we don have to coach him he working with a lot of other people i mean the what he been reared with coached with and so forth it somewhat imbedded he sees that and matter of fact some of the girls he dating uh they see that in him and i think that a quality they they say gee and and i th a i i i give them thanks because uh say hey yknow it it rough out there because uh and and the guys he runs around with good quality guys i thought wow yknow they re ornery sure but uh i i wouldn i wouldn trade his friends for anything gosh uh i don know how i came up with him i myself but which kids oh they ve been just troubled kids in the past they have yeah they were they were troubled kids in the past they came from troubled backgrounds they did well i saying but the oh i think uh i don know there that much detail but most time it comes down to a lack of uh knowing your your children how they re gonna react to certain things oh what it is uh i don know details with thing other than the fact that they re seem like there lot emptiness going on uh with them and uh and i think that part of problem we have in our uh in our life i ve uh i it be very difficult um i think uh in our in traveling if you say okay i gonna give up this life here and go to the third world and live or else do less less reverse bussing hey okay upper arlington you live northwest side why you down and live on the east side why don you live for a year no not do it for a year just go down for the day and then come back to upper arlington night and live how you like do that hm no no but that but that what i saying but but that that what i saying and the same things happening when we had a bussing we took kids out of the poor environment and put them in nice environment oh they they ve got the taste of it then went back home oh and we did and very unjustice thing to those kids and to the families and then when we broke them up we did something else yknow take them out then we lost that community involvement so now the parents can follow their kids to their activities get them splitting it up hey we don want them we don want a families that a misnomer they said the fam the community raises the family the kids yeah that how they want you to think but the family the community will not re replace the family oh yeah yeah um hum grand cayman just my wife and i this time i ah ah traveling has been even for the transportation department i travel across the state and country and before that i was always traveling we took two weeks off when we go back to fall semester that time it was semesters not quarters and uh uh get on the greyhound bus fifty dollar pass was buddy and i we just travel all over the country and sleep on the bus at night i enjoy traveling i enjoy meeting people when i go on these these travel things i have to for business i meet with the uh the the ships and so forth go back behind but then when i go to the ports uh the companies pretty much know what they contract with us i like to meet with the people there the gestapo and so forth i ll talk with them and and uh learn more about their little uh things just like down in saint croix last year uh spent two hours talking to the security there and he said boy there something wrong you guys from the continentals i said continental that what we call you guys from the states oh boy i said and this and here i here i come from this is a gentlemen that uh dark skin i don know if he black or colored i still confused as to what difference in black and colored is but uh he says yknow my brothers probably came to these islands to the to the continental they come down here and they re getting all they re swaying themselves they re acting cocky to me and so forth and i say we don do that here and i said well i know this yknow uh there a lot of black population here creole mix and that type of thing which i would consider colored not black uh to me black is black if you have anything mixed in you it colored uh but he said uh we don do that uh he said problem in the states gosh you guys aa daddy wants kid wants a car get him a car down here child only comes from the school i uh i gave him a dinner but i ask him to sweep off the front porch now i ll still give him his dinner but i ask him please did you do your sweep the front porch may not sound much but at least i trying to teach him something and you you saw all that down there in the people where we were down fredericksburg but uh it it it just those things you you learn and and there other times i was down in jamaica and you went back into the back country and you saw very impoverished uh area so i almost made a mission film where the families living with the animals in the same house and you try to understand and and you you ll never they ll never get away from poverty and the classes in our society that just life there always gonna be that but the thing is try to have understanding compassion for them and try to reach out and sometimes the people don want it either and sometimes you can see well now i know why they don want it because they don know they don know how to handle it they appreciate the thought that goes a lot longer than just giving them that because if they get it they don know what do with it so i i really i really think uh um as i was saying traveling uh people are all the same worldwide they just give them different colors different facial different accents ih so god can give them unique characteristics so he can call them his own and he knows each every one of us but uh we re all the same it down to talking about the emotions and the drive and i keep asking her keep a one thing to ask yourself and ask the business person what would you be doing today if you were born in a third world country how thankful are you that you re here and how do you show that thankfulness you re you re here for a reason and you re here in the united states for a reason of all the beatitudes you have here don you think it time to share some of those things the talent and to not necessarily be recognized for those things but yknow some some personalities require personalities that the way it is but uh to do things without expecting something in return that would be so nice to see that written on magazine fronts oh yeah yeah we re not wow what getting into these people they re not thinking yknow if we can teach people to think the way you re trying to tell me well businesses tell us we should do this then why doesn business take a more social correctiveness not political correctness no yeah the they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the deduction allowances because even when we reduce deductions it went down to yeah nowhere yknow there not a store open for miles and you re out there and your stomach starts going and you re like well it either time to get off my lazy ass and yknow make this fire useful or um i gonna die out here that that pretty much the plan of action you take when you re out there it not it not lets go over to the seven eleven and grab a slurpie and a doughnut or something it more like uh yknow that that squirrels looking kind of good right yeah yeah that pretty much what we was made to do yknow back in the pioneer days you didn have this crap with the kid going gi get fix me some canned ravioli or and you gave that kid a shotgun and he went out there and killed his own that an interesting thing i just saw on the pap in the news week i was reading that and yeah and there uh certain amount of uh gun laws that actually didn get into until i saw that here in ohio it with a long gun or a hand gun you hafta be eighteen but other places like texas there no minimum age on owning a yknow rifle or a hand gun or and you re looking like god man you pack uh just imagine this little six year old walking into the store packing oh man yeah they re gonna most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh the kentucky and maryland colorado all those school shootings and can believe man i mean there articles in there you would not even believe if you haven read them yeah talking about all these under age kids thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen even up to eighteen years old uh columbine shooting mean all those just relate in one category that yknow it getting out of control here bill do something well think a little bit safer idea than uh eliminating guns because yknow there always gonna be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem yknow more centralize it make it a national law that you hafta be a certain age give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure you re yknow not gonna just go out and blow somebody head off for no reason you re keeping it for yknow just either security reasons hunting reasons or practice yknow but yeah it the brady bill didn really do it for america like they thought i mean yeah you wait five days big deal go out on twentieth avenue and pick one up in five minutes yknow i ve seen all kinds of people carry guns that shouldn well it not it not how it put into effect the law it how it enforced yknow you don just say well yknow little johnny stuck his finger in the pie and you can do that anymore and yknow the more the more security you re gonna have over that pie the more he gonna want it so and going into the gun thing it pretty much nobody winning game mean you make stricter laws you re gonna get yknow even more more people yknow struggling to get a gun and shoot somebody head off so um oh the school thing pretty much says itself metal detectors and police at the schools yknow it come down to that nowadays and um any gun you get from criminals yknow should i mean they already mailed them at buckeye steal but there a little bit more you can do with those than burn them yknow you could set them up in uh some kind of top secret lab yknow out in somewhere the pentagon just have rooms and rooms stacked full of guns and i mean hell in case we hafta do hafta go to war yknow just keep that little reserve keep them out public hands until the right time but i think that all all in all the solution would be get rid of the criminals well how you gonna do that you don know somebody a criminal until they do something for the first time yeah and a lot of them been getting off the hook lately see this guy on uh hard copy he killed this woman husband because he was in love with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly incapable of making his own decisions now i think that there there uh things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide yknow a wider version of what they i don know what they call it it in that magazine there what triggers the violence and violent thoughts people actually do think more about the violence when they commit it than the accidental yknow some of it mindless some of it not but everybody thinks yeah it like the uh the woman that useta live in the apartment where we lived before us see she had a husband she was married too for quite some time he got on ohio number one i list with eighteen i man can you imagine how much money he put into that i mean you think your first i offense would be about a thousand dollar fine and weekend in jail or something but eighteen of them and you re racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time i think he is in jail now i think he i think he in prison and um he has no drivers license privileges for life and yknow it just goes on up the line with his convictions and stuff hum well that bathroom starting to sound good right about
